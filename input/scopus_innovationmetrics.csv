In response, research is increasing within professional offices. However, while the breadth of academic research has been well-studied, little is known about research within the professional design office. To address this gap, interviews were conducted with research leaders and principals of U.S. landscape architectural firms that promoted research as part of their services. This pilot study explored the range of research conducted; motiva-tions for engaging in research; and firms’ relationships to practice, research methods used, and perceptions of the research skills needed by employees. Examples of what constituted research in practice varied widely between interviewees and was more expansive than the traditional analytic, replicable research conducted in academia. The study found that firms had a range of organizational strat-egies, from research labs to non-profits, internal grants, and informal projects. Firms engaged in research to have a creative outlet and to inform existing projects. Engaging in research helped firms promote innovation, leadership, and marketing. Research allowed practitioners to follow topics that they were passionate about beyond the constraints of project contracts, and generally research was funded through overhead. A surprising result was that firms engaged in research to recruit and retain employees and promote continuing education. Interviewees indicated that academic programs should teach research and critical thinking skills so that graduates are better trained in justifying design decisions. Practitioners perceived a mis-match between academic research and the profession’s project-based knowledge needs, but they were receptive to collaborations with academics to address the chal-lenging questions facing the profession. Future studies are needed to understand how practitioners and academics define research as a starting point for collaboration. © 2023 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wiscons in System.","business management; design labs; innovation; motivations; Professional office","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176966015"

This metric captures a firm's realized flexibility in translating market opportunities into innovation output. We then examine the role of CEO ties with marketing and R&D in driving a firm's ISF. Combining survey data of 191 CEOs with objective performance data, we find that (a) ISF is positively influenced by the frequency and duration of the CEO's relationship with the two functional units, but negatively influenced by CEO's relationship closeness, and (b) ISF contributes to future profit growth of firms. We test the robustness of our findings to the potential violation of sequential-ignorability assumption as defined in the causal mediation literature and find the results to be robust.

The prosperity of municipal solid waste (MSW) collectors, i.e., the sanitary workers, is critical in the waste management hierarchy. Hence, the health, safety, social welfare, economic conditions and overall wellbeing of this tier need to be focused on more. Safeguarding the interests of the sanitary workers will support the MSW management sector in sustainability, which will help to generate revenue and minimize climatic impacts. An innovative MSW business model with waste ownership and technological intervention has excellent potential to support the sector towards a circular economy in Pakistan, the fifth most populous country in the world, generating about 100,000 metric tons of MSW per day. The proposed recycling business model will ensure a daily material recovery of 26,070 tons with 4721 tons of compost manufacturing in the country, which ultimately helps towards achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and meeting the targets of nationally determined contributors (NDCs) by 2030. In addition, the sector’s economic potential can contribute 5.5% to the total annual budget and possibly pay 1.4% of the gross domestic product (GDP) per annum to service national foreign debt, thus helping maintain the debt threshold value with an opportunity to accelerate the economic growth of Pakistan. © 2023 by the authors.","debt for waste swaps; Islamabad; NSMF; Pakistan; recycling business model; regenerative circular economy","Pakistan; business; economic conditions; innovation; municipal solid waste; recycling; regeneration; resource allocation; waste disposal","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152559845"

That is, implementation of the metrics will then change company behaviour with the eventual effect of a successful Net Zero transition. Different perspectives are presented, rooted in systems thinking. Numerous company examples explain why innovation, not ESG metrics, will be the prime mover in achieving Net Zero. The crux of the argument for systems thinking is that a company like Honeywell, currently given an ‘F’ ESG score, is delivering stellar innovations that will enable its customers to significantly reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. As to behaviour, boards of directors should demand new information from management with particular attention to returns on capital versus the cost of capital under scenarios that include a price (tax) on carbon. The integration of corporate finance principles with systems thinking will improve decision-making and facilitate an efficient Net Zero transition. © 2022 The Author.

This ideation can be measured by metrics such as usefulness, novelty, variety, quality, completeness, and quantity. In bioinspired design, biological analogies are used to inspire design concepts. Biological analogies have been provided in earlier studies to measure ideation effectiveness. Tools like IDEA-INSPIRE, DANE, etc., allow designers to search analogies using functions, behaviors, and structures. However, we wanted to inquire about the effect of providing a very large number of biological analogies (26), fulfilling the same function to develop bioinspired solutions. In this paper, an empirical study has been performed to analyze the effect of biological analogies on ideation. The designers are exposed to provided multiple biological analogies and generate concepts for which four ideation metrics: novelty, variety, quality, and quantity metrics are evaluated. The results are compared to the unaided condition where other designers are given the same task. A new method to measure variety using a 2D matrix has been presented. The results suggest that designers can generate bioinspired solutions when multiple biological analogies performing similar functions are provided in a presentable format. Statistically, exposure to multiple biological analogies in idea generation can significantly increase the variety of design ideas. The novelty, quality, and quantity for the biological group and control group remain the same.

The underlying idea is that growth, development, technological change, income inequality, spatial disparities, and resilience are the visible outcomes of hidden systemic interactions. The study of economic complexity seeks to understand the structure of these interactions and how they shape various socioeconomic processes. This emerging field relies heavily on big data and machine learning techniques. This brief introduction to economic complexity has three aims. The first is to summarize key theoretical foundations and principles of economic complexity. The second is to briefly review the tools and metrics developed in the economic complexity literature that exploit information encoded in the structure of the economy to find new empirical patterns. The final aim is to highlight the insights from economic complexity to improve prediction and political decision-making. Institutions including the World Bank, the European Commission, the World Economic Forum, the OECD, and a range of national and regional organizations have begun to embrace the principles of economic complexity and its analytical framework. We discuss policy implications of this field, in particular the usefulness of building recommendation systems for major public investment decisions in a complex world. © 2021 The Author(s)","Complex systems; Economic complexity; Geography; Innovation; Policy","Decision making; Economic analysis; Investments; Learning systems; Economic complexity; Geography; Income inequality; Innovation; Issues and challenges; Machine learning techniques; Societal issues; Socioeconomic process; Technological change; Theoretical foundations; Public policy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138826773"

This study differs from earlier ones in that it assesses business performance using the Balanced Scorecard model and managerial performance using the Mahoney model. In this kind of research, it is unusual to employ organizational learning and teamwork as predictor factors. This study included 140 respondents from 14 rural banks in South Kalimantan Province. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), carried out using the statistical computer application LISREL, was used to examine the data after it was obtained via a questionnaire. The findings indicate that teamwork, organizational learning, and innovation significantly impact managerial success.

Estimates show that average consumption of rice has tripled over the last 3 decades, from 9.2 million metric tons (Mt) in the early 1990s to 31.5 million Mt in 2018, with West and Central Africa accounting for nearly two-thirds of this share. The demand for rice, however, has placed an enormous economic burden on African countries, whereby they spent over USD 5.5 billion per year on rice imports over the past few years.To address this challenge, over 32 countries have established National Rice Development Strategies to increase local production and to achieve rice self-sufficiency. Several of these countries have shown policy interest to use modern biotechnological advancements, including gene editing, to ensure increases in rice productivity and reduce food imports, in the context of extreme climate vulnerability and acceleration of the effects of biotic and abiotic stresses. This review article examines the role of biotechnology in African countries' efforts to achieve rice self-sufficiency, particularly the potential for genome-editing technologies toward the genetic improvement of rice and to Africa's nascent research programs. This article notes that while gene editing offers important advances in crop breeding, like genetic engineering, it faces some persistent sociopolitical challenges and low societal acceptability. As such, international partnerships advancing genome editing in Africa's rice-subsectors development could benefit from adopting key principles from “responsible research and innovation” to help these projects achieve their potential, while bringing about more inclusive and reflexive processes that strive to anticipate the benefits and limits associated with new biotechnologies as they relate to local contexts. Such an approach could create the necessary political space to test and assess the benefits (and risks) related to adopting gene-editing technologies in Africa's rice sectors.

To achieve this, physical connectivity of systems from phlebotomy through pre-analytical to the analytical phase were paired with informatics connectivity from the patient’s national identity card to the hospital and laboratory informatics management systems (LIMS) and associated middleware. This allowed accurate time stamps to track turnaround time (TAT). TAT metrics were collected from the LIMS for inpatient, emergency room and outpatient samples and tests over a period of 7 months. This time span incorporated the 2-month period before automation was implemented. The results for all tests and specific tests are shown and the results of an analysis of the outpatient phlebotomy workflow are given. The implemented solution has improved outpatient TAT by over 54% and has shown that samples can be collected, and results obtained without touching the sample. Improving intra-laboratory TAT is an important quality goal for all laboratories. The implementation of automation is important in achieving this albeit more about obtaining predictable TAT. Automation does not necessarily improve TAT it removes variation which leads to predictable TAT (PTAT). Automation should only be considered with a strategic vision for the future as it is important to have clear goals and objectives based on the individual laboratories process and needs. Automating a poor process leads to an automated poor process. Here, an innovative use of automation, hardware and software has resulted in marked improvement in TAT across all samples processed in the central laboratory.

Otherwise, in southeastern Tunisia, diagnostics have shown that rural villages, partially occupied and exploited in an anarchic manner, are subject to real dangers that threaten their survival in the Saharan territory, considered a difficult area. Direct consequences of an unsuitable development process, these historic works are perceived as static in the face of a dynamic social process, which has led to the gradual increase in their abandonment rates. Similarly, a disfigurement of the rustic landscape results from poor adaptation due to the standardized reproduction of architectural styles “in search of modernity”. The new troglodyte modes present a versatile and capacitive cultural potential. The manifestation of cultural and spatial wealth thus emerges, with the lasting potential of constituting a vector of cultural transition for the territorial development of southeastern Tunisia. © 2023, Vilnius Gediminas Technical University.

As this concern heightens, the focus on water-energy-infrastructure-human nexus (WEIHN) becomes pivotal to achieving sustainable and resilient water management strategies. In the context of rapid urbanization and population growth, decentralized water systems (DWS) have emerged as a promising alternative to centralized water systems (CWS), offering cost-effective and environmentally sustainable solutions tailored to local water needs and demands. However, a comprehensive and integrative analysis of the economic, social, and environmental impacts needs to be considered before the implementation of DWS in WEIHN. Therefore, analyzing WEIHN at a cross-sectoral level and exploring the roles of infrastructure and humans can provide valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities associated with DWS development. This review provides a forward-looking roadmap that highlights the critical roles of the infrastructure and human perspectives in WEIHN. First, we identify roadblocks in the CWS and then point out the targeted areas supporting DWS. Second, we investigate the current capability and limitation of infrastructure spatial configuration, safety-related metrics, and interdependency in WEIHN. Third, we emphasize the significance of various human roles, including end-users, operators, and decision-makers in WEIHN. Finally, based on the review findings in water, energy, infrastructure, and human dimensions, we conduct a comprehensive in-depth analysis of innovative technologies (e.g., sensor fusion, digital water infrastructure) and effective management policies. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Cost effectiveness; Environmental impact; Population statistics; Water management; Waterworks; Centralised; Decentralized water systems; Energy infrastructures; Population growth; Rapid urbanizations; Sustainable solution; Water energy; Water management strategies; Water scarcity; Water system; decentralization; energy resource; infrastructure; innovation; water management; water resource; water supply; Decision making","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170704216"

Deep learning, a powerful tool in medical science, shows potential for non-invasive, accurate coeliac disease diagnosis, though challenges remain. Objective: This systematic review aimed to evaluate the current state of deep-learning applications in coeliac disease diagnosis and identify potential areas for future research that could enhance diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Methods: A systematic review was conducted using the following databases: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus. PRISMA guidelines were applied. Two independent reviewers identified research articles using deep learning for coeliac disease diagnosis and severity assessment. Only original research articles with performance metrics data were included. The quality of the diagnostic accuracy studies was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool, categorizing studies based on risk of bias and concerns about applicability. Due to heterogeneity, a narrative synthesis was conducted to describe the applications and efficacy of the deep-learning techniques (DLT) in coeliac disease diagnosis. Results: The initial search across four databases yielded 417 studies with 195 being removed due to duplicity. Finally, eight studies were found to be suitable for inclusion after rigorous evaluation. They were all published between 2017 and 2023 and focused on using DLT for coeliac disease diagnosis or assessing disease severity. Different deep-learning architectures were applied. Accuracy levels ranged from 84% to 95.94% with the GoogLeNet model achieving 100% sensitivity and specificity for video capsule endoscopy images. Conclusions: DLT hold substantial potential in coeliac disease diagnosis. They offer improved accuracy and the prospect of mitigating clinician bias. However, key challenges persist, notably the requirement for more extensive and diverse datasets, especially to detect milder forms of coeliac disease. These methods are in their nascent stages, underscoring the need of integrating multiple data sources to achieve comprehensive coeliac disease diagnosis. © 2023 by the authors.","coeliac disease; deep learning; diagnosis; innovation; machine learning","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179361703"

Although performance metrics are essential in an organization's management control system, little is known about how the use of metrics differs in organizations with varying dependencies on incremental and radical innovation. Drawing on data from a sample of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we hypothesize and find that firms' dependency on incremental (radical) innovation is positively (negatively) associated with metric intensity. Furthermore, we find that (1) the positive relationship between the dependency on incremental innovation and metric intensity is stronger when the organizational culture is focused more on “control” and (2) the negative relationship between the dependency on radical innovation and metric intensity is mitigated when the organizational culture is focused more on “flexibility.” Additional analysis shows that the positive (negative) relationship between incremental (radical) innovation dependency and metric intensity can be mitigated by greater use of metrics for decision-facilitating purposes. Our findings suggest that metrics-based formal controls are designed to match the types of innovation dependencies and pre-existing informal controls such as organizational culture.

The use of metrics has therefore drawn journalists into a sensitive sense-making process: They do emotional work to be able to manage the metrics-related requirements of their work. To further assess why metrics in Finland remains a sensitive issue, in this article we ask: 1) What is the Finnish news professionals' emotional work about metrics directed at? 2) What is the relationship between this emotional work and the cycle of disruption and innovation? The empirical material consists of nine qualitative interviews with Finnish news managers and a set of open-ended survey responses from the editorial staff of the largest Finnish daily, Helsingin Sanomat. In addition, eight background interviews with third-party analytics providers were used as supportive material. We conclude that the emotional work is centred on relief, excitement, and stress, and it is directed at seeing the audience as an algorithmic conception, increasing the organisations' capabilities through learning, and maintaining autonomy, respectively. Emotional work thus alleviates and stimulates, as well as balances journalism's relationship with the disruptive innovation of metrics.  © 2023 Laura Ahva et al., published by Sciendo.","audience metrics; disruption; emotional work; innovation; journalism","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161340610"

Previous force monitoring has been achieved through the development of specialized and adapted instruments or use designs that are incompatible with neurosurgical workflow. OBJECTIVE: To design a universal sensorised surgical glove to detect intraoperative forces, applicable to any surgical procedure, and any surgical instrument in either hand. METHODS: We created a sensorised surgical glove that was calibrated across 0 to 10 N. A laboratory experiment demonstrated that the sensorised glove was able to determine instrument-tissue forces. Six expert and 6 novice neurosurgeons completed a validated grape dissection task 20 times consecutively wearing the sensorised glove. The primary outcome was median and maximum force (N). RESULTS: The sensorised glove was able to determine instrument-tissue forces reliably. The average force applied by experts (2.14 N) was significantly lower than the average force exerted by novices (7.15 N) (P = .002). The maximum force applied by experts (6.32 N) was also significantly lower than the maximum force exerted by novices (9.80 N) (P = .004). The sensorised surgical glove’s introduction to operative workflow was feasible and did not impede on task performance. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate a novel and scalable technique to detect forces during neurosurgery. Force analysis can provide real-time data to optimize intraoperative tissue forces, reduce the risk of tissue injury, and provide objective metrics for training and assessment.

While effective, this can lead to local “hill climbing” rather than a more radical and innovative departure from standard methods. Moreover, if many participants build on similar baselines, the overall diversity of approaches considered may be limited. In this work, we propose a new class of IR evaluation metrics intended to promote greater diversity of approaches in evaluation campaigns. Whereas traditional IR metrics focus on user experience, our two “innovation” metrics instead reward exploration of more divergent, higher-risk strategies finding relevant documents missed by other systems. Experiments on four TREC collections show that our metrics do change system rankings by rewarding systems that find such rare, relevant documents. This result is further supported by a controlled, synthetic data experiment, and a qualitative analysis. In addition, we show that our metrics achieve higher evaluation stability and discriminative power than the standard metrics we modify.

The 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party proposed a development strategy for implementing regionally coordinated development, building a new development pattern, promoting high-quality development, and accelerating the rejuvenation and development of special areas such as the revolutionary old regions. However, there is an overemphasis on economic development metrics, a disregard for local practices and characteristics, and a blending of processes and outcomes associated with the high-quality regional development evaluation indicators. To solve these issues, it is essential to establish a set of tailored indicators to evaluate and guide the high-quality and differentiated development of counties in the old revolutionary base areas. Harnessing the essence of high-quality development concept, this study proposes a logical framework for constructing an evaluation index system for high-quality development in counties within the revolutionary old areas. Using the old revolutionary base areas in Southern Jiangxi and Western Fujian as the study areas, a three-level coding process based on grounded theory was employed. This rigorous approach enabled the scientific construction of an evaluation index system for high-quality development in the revolutionary old areas. This index system comprises seven dimensions, namely, innovation-driven, economic development, urban-rural coordination, people's well-being, ecological civilization, internal and external openness, and red culture, encompassing 40 indicators. Furthermore, a critical understanding of high-quality development in the revolutionary old areas, emphasizing the need to inherit, preserve, and promote red culture as a contemporary task guided by new developmental concepts, was gained. The aim was to facilitate enhancing both the scale and structure of economic development. This indicator system uses the entropy method to ascertain the indicator weights and subsequently performs a comprehensive evaluation of the study areas. The findings indicate that innovation-driven factors play a significant role in driving the differences in the high-quality development of the revolutionary old areas. In contrast, ecological civilization is yet to exhibit sufficient potential as a driving force for high-quality development at the current stage. Notably, significant disparities exist in the level of high-quality development between the demonstration areas of Ganzhou and the old revolutionary base areas of western Fujian. These disparities are most evident in the spatial core-edge structure. Additionally, counties at the provincial boundaries demonstrate relatively low levels of high-quality development, warranting increased attention to future high-quality revitalization and development efforts. In comparison to previous research, this study contributes in three key ways. First, an evaluation index system has been constructed using a combined top-down and bottom-up approach, incorporating indicators that account for local practices and characteristics, offering a novel perspective for establishing a high-quality development index system. Second, the national strategic positioning of county-level research units in urban-rural integration development, rural revitalization, and urbanization is highlighted, with county towns identified as pivotal carriers. Urban-rural coordination was identified to be the focus of coordination at the county level.

With one year to go before its official release, the study of the beta versions of the 0.2 framework is crucial to know the strategy of the taskforce regarding metrics and sectors with high natural risks. Its big sister, the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosure or TCFD, had defined the health sector as a non-key in terms of climate change and carbon risks, but the TNFD decided that it was a priority in terms of nature-related risks and co-dependencies. This research therefore focuses on the innovations of the TNFD and its impact on future disclosures in the sector. The goal being to predict if the TNFD will lead to more disclosures and therefore better risk management from the health firms. To complete this research, the analysis of the sector’s risks and dependencies on nature-related issues and biodiversity loss was essential. To do so, a policy analysis on the framework of the TNFD was conducted, as well as a literature review on nature related risks and opportunities for the health sector. The Health Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp) was analysed to highlight the Task Force’s focus on the health sector. Finally, a due diligence of the TNFD’s stakeholders and partners was carried out to ascertain the interest and participation of health sector actors in the TNFD. Results have shown that Nature risks were important for the sector and that the TNFD was giving more importance to the sector in terms of priority. On the contrary, the health sector does not show an improved interest in this new taskforce. There is a need for more research in the implementation of Nature-financial metrics for disclosures. © 2022 by the authors.","biodiversity loss and financial risks; health sector financial risks; health sector nature dependency; health sector nature risks; health sector risk management; nature opportunities; nature risk assessment; nature-related financial disclosures; TCFD; TNFD","Carbon; Policy Making; Risk Management; carbon; biodiversity; finance; health services; innovation; policy analysis; research work; risk assessment; article; biodiversity; risk assessment; risk management; management","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140802944"

To begin, the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of deep FoRT are analyzed in view of the development status quo of urban China. Next, a multi-criteria assessment model driven by real-world data and 11 quantified metrics is proposed to judge the suitability for developing the MRT-based integrated logistics system (MILS) in 16 Chinese cities. Finally, critical factors influencing MILS project adoption are explicated, and the possible supportive policies are discussed from aspects of planning, regulation, funding, marketization, and innovations. Results show that the alignment with national development goals, rich social-environmental benefits, and stakeholder interest are the primary drivers of deep FoRT strategy, whereas poor planning and decision-making, governance and management deficiencies, and high investment could be the main hurdles.

Gamification has emerged among teachers as a powerful teaching strategy that favors students' motivation and behavioral change by applying game elements in nongame contexts. Purpose: To examine the effects of a 14-week gamification-based teaching program, including the use of a game-based mobile app on body composition in college students. Materials and Methods: One hundred twelve college students (21.22 ± 2.55 years) were assigned to a gamification-based group or a control group. College students from the intervention group participated in a gamification program under the narrative of ""STAR WARS""and had a mobile app with a countdown timer. They had to meet physical activity recommendations to gain lifetime (i.e., sum time to the countdown). A portable eight-polar bioelectrical impedance analysis was used to obtain body composition outcomes; height (cm) was measured with a stadiometer; and waist circumference (cm) was measured using a metric tape. Body mass index (BMI), muscle mass index, fat mass index, and body fat percentage were computed. Results: Participants from the gamification program reported a significantly lower BMI, waist circumference, fat mass index and body fat percentage after the intervention, in comparison with the control group, indicated by an effect size ranging from -0.23 to -0.11 (all P ≤ 0.043). Conclusion: Gamification and the use of interactive mobile app are powerful teaching strategies in higher education to motivate students toward healthier lifestyles that lead to body composition benefits.  © 2022 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","Fatness; Gamification; Innovation; Mobile app; Motivation; University","Body Composition; Gamification; Humans; Mobile Applications; Students; Video Games; body composition; human; mobile application; physiology; student; video game","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140272509"

VBA may limit the effect of interpersonal bias on assessment scores. However, before VBA is implemented widely, stakeholders’ perceptions ought to be explored, including potential benefits and challenges. Methods: Using the qualitative methods of hermeneutical phenomenology, the authors explored both trainee and faculty educators’ perspectives on VBA using semi-structured interviews. Participants were recruited from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Toronto. Data underwent thematic analysis and was validated by the investigator and theoretical triangulation. Results: The authors interviewed 9 physicians (5 faculty and 4 residents). Four dominant themes were identified, including advantages compared to traditional methods, the role of feedback and coaching, challenges integrating VBA, and considerations for implementation. Conclusions: Surgical trainees and faculty feel that VBA is a worthy tool to advance equity and fairness in assessment, but felt it was better as a vehicle for feedback and coaching. VBA cannot be used as a standalone assessment metric without additional evidence for its validity. If implemented, residency programs can use VBA as an adjunct to other evaluation measures to facilitate coaching, provide asynchronous feedback, and limit assessment bias. © 2023","innovation; residency training; surgical education","Clinical Competence; Faculty, Medical; Gynecology; Humans; Internship and Residency; Laparoscopy; Obstetrics; adult; fairness; gynecology; human; letter; obstetrics; phenomenology; physician; qualitative analysis; qualitative research; residency education; resident; semi structured interview; skill; surgical training; thematic analysis; theoretical study; validity; videorecording; clinical competence; education; gynecology; laparoscopy; medical education; medical school; obstetrics","Letter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163745767"

These ARs carry a huge amount of water in the form of vapor and thus landfalling of these ARs may bring either a beneficial supply of water or may create hazardous flood situations and thus cause damage to life and property. These regions have been statistically characterized as intense integrated water vapor transport (IVT) regions in the troposphere based on various thresholds of magnitude, direction, and geometry. To enhance the knowledge of data-driven methods for modelling nonlinear atmospheric dynamics associated with ARs, a first ever study with data-driven methodology incorporating a Deep Learning architecture, Autoencoder has been proposed. While training the proposed model, the Adam optimizer was used to reduce the mean squared error loss and was optimized using the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) and Sigmoid activation functions. The prediction results of the availability of ARs at next frames by the Autoencoder were assessed by popularly used performance evaluation metrics structural similarity index metrics (SSMI), mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR). We have got comparatively higher scores (average) of SSIM (0.739) and PSNR (64.422) and lower scores (average) of RMSE (0.155) and MSE (0.0247) for AR prediction from our model which signifies the accuracy of the proposed Autoencoder in capturing AR dynamics. The findings of the study could be useful in giving important insights to incorporate Deep Learning models for forecasting ARs at significant lead time and consequently reducing the risk and increasing the resilience of AR flood prone regions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Atmospheric rivers; Autoencoder; Deep learning; Floods; Integrated water vapor transport; Machine learning","Deep learning; Errors; Floods; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mean square error; Moisture; Signal to noise ratio; Water vapor; Atmospheric river; Auto encoders; Deep learning; Integrated water vapor transport; Integrated water vapors; Machine-learning; Mean squared error; Peak signal to noise ratio; Root mean squared errors; Water vapor transport; flood; innovation; machine learning; moisture content; transport process; troposphere; water vapor; Rivers","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152619977"

How these institutions have tried to address this issue has been diverse. To standardize, homogenize, and validate these sustainable practices, a few years ago, the University of Indonesia Green Metric positioned itself as the internationally accepted ranking; however, other rankings have begun to emerge, such as the Times Higher Education Impact Ranking, which also addresses the search for compliance of the SDGs. For a novel or incipient university to establish the politics and actions to fulfill sustainability and SDGs or stay on track may represent a disorienting and challenging task, particularly when these rankings have different origins or criteria. So, this research aimed to review the top ten universities and their actions in the University of Indonesia Green Metric and Times Higher Education Impact Ranking, along with the organizational initiatives in education, to clarify the key measures and actions adopted by universities toward sustainability and their participation in the rankings, to pursue the SDGs related to social and environmental impacts in universities. Additionally, as a case study, we analyzed in detail the actions performed by the Tecnologico de Monterrey (located at the 274th and 100–200th places of the University of Indonesia Green Metric and the Times Higher Education Impact Ranking, respectively) and compared them with those of Top Ten Higher Education Institutions in both rankings. As a result, a summary guide of the actions is suggested to guide higher education institutions in adopting the required level of sustainability development indicated in the rankings. © 2023 by the authors.","educational innovation; environmental education; higher education; sustainability; sustainable development goals (SDGs); university rankings","Indonesia; exploration; higher education; innovation; politics; sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; university sector","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149906196"

One variant relies on innovation teams to rapidly prototype ideas as Proofs-of-Concept (POC) that, when successful, are matured and commercialized as new technical solutions within product lines. However, as the number of ideas grows, diversity of in-scope energy systems broadens, and resources remain constrained, identifying the highest-value ideas aligned with innovation goals and enterprise strategy has become paramount. We outline a prioritization and selection (PAS) approach founded on systems engineering (SE) to manage the work progressed within an innovation team. Specifically, we adapt the tradespace methodology for design selection when stakeholder needs and project constraints create a multi-objective optimization problem. The assessment combines a rigorous stakeholder analysis and surveys to characterize a multi-attribute utility function measuring POC benefit. POC resources are estimated from anticipated duration, development needs, validation requirements, and process change required by the technical solutions. These metrics characterize cost-benefit trade-offs, complemented by innovation measures associated with each POC. The final end-to-end workflow enables innovation idea comparisons with a dashboard to guide POC selection, portfolio shaping, and work prioritization across multiple energy disciplines and industry asset classes. © 2022 The authors and IOS Press.","decision support tools and methods; innovation; portfolio management; system engineering; Systems thinking; value engineering and practice","Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Decision support systems; Economic and social effects; Financial data processing; Investments; Multiobjective optimization; Systems thinking; Value engineering; Decision support tool and method; Decision supports; Innovation; Portfolio managements; Proof of concept; Support method; Support tool; System thinkings; Tools and methods; Value engineering and practice; Systems engineering","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142158482"

Models of Duality Innovation and Multinational Enterprise Performance with a Measurement of Corporate Risks from 2000 to 2015 were developed using corporate finance literature and data. The models show positive relationships between duality innovations and multinational enterprise performance. Furthermore, there has been an increasing level of corporate risks over the years when measured by both the duality innovation and multinational enterprise performance metrics. This article discusses the findings of this research project. It explains how they can help understand international enterprise performance while also explaining how to determine a potential risk profile for an individual or multiple companies.

A hybrid predictive model based on the artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm that is embedded within the COOT method (COOT bird natural life model-artificial neural network (COOT-ANN)) is developed and evaluated for its suitability for the prediction of daily ETo at seven meteorological stations in different states of Australia. Accordingly, a daily statistical period of 12 years (01-01-2010 to 31-12-2021) for climatic data of maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and ETo were collected. The results are evaluated using six performance criteria metrics: correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), RMSE-observation standard deviation ratio (RSR), Scatter Index (SI), and mean absolute error (MAE) along with the Taylor diagrams. The performance of the COOT-ANN model was compared with those of the conventional ANN model. The results showed that the COOT-ANN hybrid model outperforms the ANN model at all seven stations by 0.803%, 4.127%, 3.359%, 4.072%, 4.148%, and 3.665% based on the average values of the R, RMSE, NSE, RSR, SI, and MAE criteria, respectively. So, this study provides an innovative method for prediction in agricultural and water resource studies.

This novel measure of innovation captures the extent to which the firm generates revenue from its research & development and is, therefore, more economically meaningful. The authors also use a text-based measure of innovation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors rely on a quasi-natural experiment based on the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that compelled certain firms to raise board independence. The difference-in-difference analysis is far less vulnerable to endogeneity and is more likely to show a causal influence, rather than a mere association. Findings: The results show that more independent directors improve innovation efficiency significantly. Specifically, firms forced to raise board independence experienced a much higher increase in innovation than those not required to change their board composition. The authors also explore another novel measure of innovation, a text-based metric of innovation. Originality/value: The research is original in several ways. First, the authors take advantage of an exogenous regulatory shock as a quasi-natural experiment. This approach is far less susceptible to endogeneity. Second, the authors use a novel measure of innovation efficiency, i.e. research quotient, which is more economically meaningful. Finally, the authors use a unique measure of innovation derived from powerful textual analysis. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Board independence; Boards of directors; Corporate governance; Independent directors; Innovation; Sarbanes-Oxley","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163016299"

It is essential to know the suitable proxies in measuring innovation related to risk taking. Many studies use research-and-development intensity (RDI) and research-and-development spending (RDS) as proxies for innovation related to risk taking. However, little evidence shows that positive association with risk taking. This study addresses this gap by using RDI and RDS as metrics for measuring innovation and assessing innovation-related risks. This study incorporated performance as a potential factor affecting the interaction between these variables. It is essential to consider the risks associated with innovation and allocate the RDI and RDS effectively to maximize revenue. We used a dataset of 3955 firm-year observations obtained from 548 listed firms in the Indonesian stock exchange for 2012–2021. We found that RDI and RDS positively affect risk taking. The test results show that the interaction between innovation and firm performance negatively affects risk taking. Thus, firm performance may mitigate the risks associated with innovation. Therefore, firms must balance their innovation projects with improved performance to minimize risks and achieve long-term success. © 2023 by the authors.","firm performance; innovation; R&D intensity; R&D spending; risk","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169009951"

However, it must be transformed to respond to emerging demands in society for better financial products and services with a positive impact on living conditions and well-being. To achieve this, banks must create economic value—that is to say, banks should create profits in a sustained manner—in order to also create social value and thus generate shared value. The purpose of this study was twofold. The first aim was to identify the main factors that contributed to the majority of Mexican banking profits in the period from 2003 to 2021; the second aim of the study was to provide an innovative metric of banking performance. Using supervised machine learning algorithms and Principal Component Analysis, two prediction models were tested, and two banking performance indices were defined. The findings show that Random Forest is a reliable profit prediction model with a lower mean absolute error between the predicted yearly profit and losses and the actual data. There are no significant ranking position differences between the two performance indices. The first performance index obtained is novel due to its simplicity, since it is built on the basis of five values associated with commercial banking activity. In Mexico, no similar studies have been published. The indicator most widely used by regulators worldwide is the CAMELS index, which is a weighted average of the capital adequacy level, asset quality, management capacity, profitability, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risk. Its scale of 1 to 5 is useful for identifying the robustness and solvency of a bank, but not necessarily its capacity to generate profits. This approach might encourage banks to remain aware of their potential to create shared value and to develop competitive strategies to increase benefits for stakeholders. © 2023 by the authors.","banking sector; economic value; innovation; principal component analysis; shared value creation; social value","Mexico; banking; innovation; machine learning; principal component analysis; profitability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152774775"

Gross ecosystem product (GEP) is a measure of the aggregate monetary value of final ecosystem-related goods and services in a specific area and for a given accounting period. GEP accounting captures the use of many ecosystem services in production processes across the economy, which are then valued in terms of their benefits to society. GEP has five key elements that make it transparent, trackable, and readily understandable: (1) a focus on nature’s contributions to people; (2) the measurement of ecosystem assets as stocks and ecosystem services as flows; (3) the quantification of ecosystem service use; (4) an understanding of ecosystem service supply chains through value realization; and (5) the disaggregation of benefits across groups. Correspondingly, a series of innovative policies based on GEP have been designed and implemented in China. The theoretical and practical lessons provided by these experiences can support continued policy innovation for green and inclusive development around the world. © 2023, The Author(s).","Ecosystem accounting; Ecosystem assets; Ecosystem services; Gross ecosystem product; Nature’s contribution to people; Valuing nature","China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Humans; China; economic policy; ecosystem service; environmental economics; environmental policy; Gross Domestic Product; innovation; quantitative analysis; supply chain management; China; ecosystem; environmental protection; human","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176004789"

This article explores the role of enterprise agility in today’s business landscape at Latam branch of Tata Consultancy Services, where organizations face complex and diverse operations. We aim to examine how companies can become more agile in the face of emerging challenges and seize opportunities swiftly to drive growth and deliver value. Since 2014, the division has embarked on an agile transformation journey to drive growth, deliver value, foster innovation, and build resilience in an increasingly dynamic environment. We scrutinize an approach to measuring and enhancing enterprise agility, employing statistical analysis and continuous improvement methodologies to tackle real-world challenges while offering valuable insights and recommendations for organizations aiming to implement similar systems. The results of an agile transformation in a certain company’s Latam branch serve as a compelling case study, demonstrating how the implementation of targeted measures and continuous improvement can significantly bolster enterprise agility. Methodologically, our work applies a novel sequence of parametric statistical tests which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been used in the industry to validate the results of business agility metrics. In future work, we aim to create a new workflow considering non-parametric tests to address data with other statistical distributions. We conclude our work by proposing a sequence of steps for organizations to implement business agility metrics. © 2023 by the authors.","business agility; data analytics; enterprise agility; metrics; organizational transformation; statistics","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166240650"

We distinguish between prolific inventors, with high numbers of patents registered in their name, and high-quality inventors, with portfolios comprising patents with large numbers of citations. Using patent data for more than 600,000 inventors, we find that star inventors differ from the pool of non-star inventors in terms of gender: while for non-star inventors being a woman constitutes a significant disadvantage, for stars it actually presents a positive association both with quantity and quality of innovative outputs. Moreover, career length constitutes a key premium for female inventors’ productivity, but with smaller magnitudes among stars. The only exception where we observe no gender differences is among inventors with large portfolios (more than five patent families): among them, women do not display any significant gap in the quality of outputs, nor does career length provide a gendered premium. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","career; Gender gap; innovation; patents; productivity","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129578643"

This research focuses on building a novel hybrid Machine Learning (ML) model by integrating two powerful algorithms namely Random Forest (RF) and Logistic Regression (LR) to assess the intensity of the I&E in education from the data acquired from 25 leading Higher Educational Institution's (HEI) in different provinces. The major contributions to the work are, (1) construction of quality index for each topic of interest using individual RF, (2) ranking the indicators based on the quality index to assess the strength and weaknesses, (3) and finally use the LR algorithm study the quality of each indicator. The efficacy of the proposed hybrid model is validated using the benchmark classification metrics to assess its learning and prediction performance in evaluating the quality of I&E education.

This research examines whether affiliate marketing initials of cryptocurrency wallet applications affect their digital marketing efficiency, as well as whether air forwarding firms’ website visibility could be benefited from them. After collecting the required Web Analytic data, the authors performed statistical analysis (correlations and linear regressions), followed by Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) macroanalysis and Hybrid Modeling (HM) microanalysis to assess the outcomes of cryptocurrency wallet applications’ affiliate marketing programs. Hence, from the deployed methodology, valuable insights arose. The first part of the produced outcomes concerns the effect of cryptocurrency wallet application affiliate marketing metrics on their digital marketing results. The increased implications of affiliate marketing metrics (referring domains, backlinks, etc.) decrease the number of pages their visitors see. Regarding the air forwarder firms’ website visibility, specific metrics (branded and referral traffic) were increased and others (social traffic) were decreased from the increment of cryptocurrency wallet application affiliate marketing metrics (backlinks, internal links, etc.). Supply chain firms, in the air forwarding sector, could have increased website visibility by deploying advertisements and affiliate marketing initiatives with cryptocurrency wallet organizations. Summing up, specific affiliate marketing metrics of cryptocurrency wallet applications are capable of significantly impacting their digital marketing performance and also constitute determinant factors of supply chain firms’ website visibility. © 2023 by the authors.","big data; blockchain; Decision Support Systems (DSSs); digitalization; innovation; process optimization; strategic digital marketing; supply chain; sustainability","decision support system; digitization; general process or activity; innovation; market system; marketing; statistical analysis; supply chain management; sustainability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159289756"

We draw on a case study of technology incubation, a complex site where attempts to meet the sometimes conflicting demands of stakeholders inevitably lead to multiple assessments of the value of innovation. We propose a theoretical model inspired by Beunza and Garud's (2007) notion of calculative frame, positing that each frame expresses value in terms of a dominant principle of worth, a metaphorical root, and the key metrics of worth. We then explore how and under what conditions the tensions among frames are mediated by compromising metrics. Our paper contributes to the literature on socio-materiality by strengthening the conceptual linkages between the elements of calculative frames and theorizing their co-constituted character. In this way we broaden the applicability of the calculative frame model to performance measurement in complex organizations. We also contribute to the management accounting literature on tensions and compromise by providing an account of the agency of performance metrics and the mechanisms of combinability through which they mediate a compromise among conflicting frames, and bridge frames that are not in conflict. © 2023 The Author","Calculative frames; Compromising metrics; Innovation; Multiple values; Performance measurement; Technology incubation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164335575"

Semi-structured interviews (n = 30) were used to collect data. We found several issues referring to (1) challenges and approaches to normative management, (2) how the innovation ecosystem is engaged, (3) how goals and metrics relate to CE, and (4) resources and coordination regarding the CE initiative. Overall, current exploitative approaches are favored over explorative, mirroring an undesired imbalance between the two. We suggest several ways to counteract this. For example, (1) addressing existing norms so that they align with the ambitions in CE, (2) actively managing collaboration in the innovation ecosystem, including radically new setups of different actors, and (3) that managers need to carefully consider when and how to use goals and measurements in a circular strategy deployment, to foster both radical and incremental innovation. © 2022 The Authors.

However, the established indicator landscape lacks timeliness and accuracy. In this study, we focus on the country of Mauritius that is transforming its economy towards the information and communication technology (ICT) sector. We seek to extend the knowledge base on innovation activity and the status quo of innovation in Mauritius by applying an unsupervised machine learning approach. Building on previous work on new experimental innovation indicators, we combine recent advances in web mining and topic modeling and address the following research questions: What are potential areas of innovation activity in the ICT sector of Mauritius? Furthermore, do web mining and topic modeling provide sufficient indicators to understand innovation activities in emerging countries? To answer these questions, we apply the natural language processing (NLP) technique of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to ICT companies’ website text data. We then generate topic models from the scraped text data. As a result, we derive seven categories that describe the innovation activities of ICT firms in Mauritius. Albeit the model approach fulfills the requirements for innovation indicators as suggested in the Oslo Manual, it needs to be combined with additional metrics for innovation, for example, with traditional indicators such as patents, to unfold its potential. Furthermore, our approach carries methodological implications and is intended to be reproduced in similar contexts of scarce or unavailable data or where traditional metrics have demonstrated insufficient explanatory power. © 2023, The Author(s).","Developing countries; Emerging countries; ICT sector; Indicators; Innovation; Natural language processing; Topic modeling; Web mining","","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177643012"

How e-learning is being managed and identifying opportunities for improvement in this process is a challenge for managers. A systematic review of the literature on e-learning was carried out from the perspective of process management. The Scimat and VOSviewer software were used together to make it possible to understand the volume of publications, terms, density, and perspectives of studies on the subject on the indexing platforms, as well as pointing out challenges and trends in the area. The term e-learning does not appear as a trend driver in published articles. When related to the terms critical success factors (CSFs) and competitiveness and innovation, the greatest concentration of articles is directed to the e-learning infrastructure or technologies applied to it. As a result, it is possible to observe that the co-occurrence of e-learning with critical success factors and competitiveness and innovation is in its early stages, with scarce research in this area indicating room for future growth.

Previous researchers constructed homogeneous information networks to analyze the influence of patents based on citation ranking algorithms. However, a patent information network is a complex network containing multiple pieces of information (e.g., citation, applicant, inventor), and the use of a single information network will result in incomplete information or information loss, and the obtained results are biased. In addition, scholars constructed centrality indicators to assess the importance of patents with less consideration of the age bias problem of algorithms and models, and the results obtained are inaccurate. In this paper, based on the Chinese green patent (CNGP) dataset from 1985 to 2020, a CNGP heterogeneous applicant-citation network is constructed, and the rescaling method and normalization procedure are used to solve the age bias. The results illustrate that the method proposed in this paper is able to identify significant patents earlier, and the performance of the rescaled indegree (R_ID) works best such as the IR score is 17.32% in the top 5% of the rankings, and it is the best in the constructed dynamic heterogeneous networks as well. In addition, the constructed heterogeneous information network has better results compared with the traditional homogeneous information network, such as the NIR score of R_ID metrics can be improved by 2% under the same condition. Therefore, the analysis method proposed in this paper can reasonably evaluate the quality of patents and identify significant patents earlier, thus providing a new method for scientists to measure the quality of patents. © 2022 by the authors.","age bias; Chinese green patents; green innovation; heterogeneous network","China; environmental protection; innovation; spatiotemporal analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141720015"

This term that is booming today is known as the Internet of Things. In order to deal with these data close to the source, the term Edge Computing arises. The main objective is to address the limitations of cloud processing and satisfy the growing demand for applications and services that require low latency, greater efficiency and real-time response capabilities. Furthermore, it is essential to underscore the intrinsic connection between artificial intelligence and edge computing within the context of our study. This integral relationship not only addresses the challenges posed by data proliferation but also propels a transformative wave of innovation, shaping a new era of data processing capabilities at the network’s edge. Edge devices can perform real-time data analysis and make autonomous decisions without relying on constant connectivity to the cloud. This article aims at analysing and comparing Edge Computing devices when artificial intelligence algorithms are deployed on them. To this end, a detailed experiment involving various edge devices, models and metrics is conducted. In addition, we will observe how artificial intelligence accelerators such as Tensor Processing Unit behave. This analysis seeks to respond to the choice of a device that best suits the necessary AI requirements. As a summary, in general terms, the Jetson Nano provides the best performance when only CPU is used. Nevertheless the utilisation of a TPU drastically enhances the results. © 2023 by the authors.","device; edge computing; metrics; model; TensorFlow Lite; TPU","Artificial intelligence; Data handling; Cloud processing; Computing devices; Edge computing; Growing demand; Low latency; Metric; Real time response; Response capability; Tensorflow lite; TPU; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; benchmarking; cloud computing; data analysis; data processing; drug therapy; human; internet of things; Edge computing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179184216"

In this study, we introduce the concept of the k-step h-index and investigate its applicability in citation networks at different levels, including papers, authors, and institutions. By incorporating higher generations of citation information, the k-step h-index provides a comprehensive and nuanced measure of scientific influence. It demonstrates exponential growth in k-step citations, capturing valuable information from the Hirsch core and tail. Through power law distribution analysis, we uncover the presence of highly influential entities coexisting with less influential ones, revealing the heterogeneity of impact within citation networks. To validate the effectiveness of the k-step h-index, we utilize a vast dataset from APS, conducting a thorough examination of its consistency and convergent validity. Our findings demonstrate strong correlations between the k-step h-index and conventional metrics, as well as alignment with measures of innovation. This confirms the reliability of the k-step h-index and its ability to capture innovative contributions. Notably, when compared to benchmarks, the k-step h-index outperforms in accurately ranking expert-selected items, including milestone papers, distinguished authors, and prestigious institutions. Higher values of the k-step h-index consistently exhibit superior performance, showcasing their predictive power in identifying prominent scientific entities.

Online customers buy the same product in multiple sizes or colors with the intention of returning what is not necessary as they are unable to have a tactile experience during their purchase. In terms of sustainability, returns have a huge negative impact on the environment, causing waste sent to landfills and carbon emissions. In the United States alone, over 15 million metric tons of carbon dioxide are annually emitted from transporting returned inventory. This study explored an innovative way to help reduce online returns due to fit and sizing issues using four-dimensional (4D) golf apparel wear simulation. The study observed how online customers reacted to an apparel wear simulation where they could see the body–clothing interactions, such as dynamic changes in the drape of a garment and cloth deformations caused by different body movements, with a focus on golf apparel. Female customers (n = 13) with experience playing golf and purchasing golf apparel online participated in randomized experiments where three different e-commerce demo websites embedded with simulations were shown. In-depth interviews were followed to collect qualitative data, and surveying was used to quantitatively assess the perceived usefulness of 4D golf apparel wear simulations. The findings of the study indicated that the wear simulation has the potential to help customers find the correct fit and size when shopping online. By exploring the idea of providing a more accurate representation of how apparel fits and interacts with the body, this study sheds light on the promising approach of leveraging 4D golf apparel wear simulations in online shopping to enhance sustainable fashion and potentially contribute to reducing the carbon footprint by minimizing returns. © 2023 by the authors.","bracketing; garment simulation; golf apparel; returns; technological innovation for sustainable fashion","United States; carbon dioxide; carbon footprint; electronic commerce; innovation; perception; shopping activity; simulation; surveying","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166172897"

Narrative review. Objective. The aim was to utilize the lessons from the digital transformation of industries beyond healthcare, weigh the changing forces within the healthcare ecosystem, and provide a framework for the likely state of spine care delivery in the future. Summary of Background Data. Advances in technology have transformed the way in which we as consumers interact with most products and services, driven by devices, platforms, and a dramatic increase in the availability of digital data. Spine care delivery, and much of healthcare in general, has lagged far behind, hamstrung by regulatory limitations, narrow data networks, limited digital platforms, and cultural attachment to legacy care delivery models. Methods. The authors present a narrative review of the current state of the spine field in this dynamic and evolving environment. Results. The past several decades of spine innovation have largely been driven by ""hardware"" improvements, such as instrumentation, devices, and enabling technologies to facilitate procedures. These changes, while numerous, have largely resulted in modest incremental improvements in clinical outcomes. The next phase of growth in spine care, however, is likely to be more reflective of the broader innovation ecosystem that has already transformed most other industries, characterized by improvements in ""software,"" including: (1) leveraging data analytics with growing electronic health records databases to optimize interactions between patients and providers, (2) expanding digital and telemedicine platforms to create integrated hybrid service lines, (3) data modeling for patient and provider decision aids, (4) deploying provider and service line performance metrics to improve quality, and (5) movement toward more free market dynamics as patients increasingly move beyond legacy limited health system networks.

Compared to inpatient care, HIH has demonstrated improved patient safety, effectiveness, and patient and caregiver satisfaction. The VA Office of Geriatrics & Extended Care (GEC) has supported the development of 12 HIH program sites nationally, yet adoption in VA remains modest, and questions remain regarding optimal implementation practices to extend reach and adaptability of this innovation. Guided by theoretical and procedural implementation science frameworks, this study aims to systematically gather evidence from the 12 HIH programs and to develop a participatory approach to engage stakeholders, assess readiness, and develop/adapt implementation strategies and evaluation metrics. Research design and methods: We propose a multi-phase concurrent triangulation design comprising of (1) qualitative interviews with key informants and document review, (2) quantitative evaluation of effectiveness outcomes, and (3) mixed-methods synthesis and adaptation of a Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM)-guided conceptual framework. Results: The prospective phase will involve a participatory process of identifying stakeholders (leadership, HIH staff, veterans, and caregivers), engaging in planning meetings informed by implementation mapping, and developing implementation logic models and blueprints. The process will be assessed using a mixed-methods approach through participant observation and document review. Discussion and implication: This study will support the continued spread of HIH programs, generate a catalog of HIH implementation evidence, and create implementation tools and infrastructure for future HIH development. The multi-phase nature of informing prospective planning with retrospective analysis is consistent with the Learning Health System framework. © 2022, The Author(s).","Home care; Hospital at Home; Innovation; Older adults; Veterans","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164475597"

This pace of change results both in missed opportunities for a technology in its ability to contribute to effective solutions in addressing issues such as reducing adverse environmental impact or improving the health of society. In considering the nature of technological innovation and development, the associated engineering design processes can themselves be characterized as being associated with a highly complex, iterative problem-solving exercises, involving the integration and synthesis of a wide range of technologies. This in turn requires the design team to manage trade-offs across a range of primary constraints, as for instance embodied energy in manufacturing, energy consumption in use, capital costs and operating and resource recovery costs. Further investigation into the complexity of societal issues and means for achieving a more effective and fuller utilization of both existing resources and technologies is necessary to place sustainability as a priority of the decision making process. To support discussion and provide context, three case studies are presented. The first case study examines a strategic framework adopting metrics aligned with environmental issues used as proxies for evaluating wellbeing and common good. The second case study examines the specific contribution of eHealth to wellbeing and the balance of technological, societal and political issues in determining outcomes. The third case study considers how technology might be embedded as part of the process of obtaining meta-data from within a small rural community to demonstrate the impact of mitigation strategies associated with the reduction of its carbon footprint, and hence on climate change. In doing so, the paper seeks to bring together issues surrounding environmental problems in relation to a technology driven engineering design process while positioning them in the context of social benefits arising from sustainable decision making. © 2022 by the authors.","decision making; engineering design; environment; sustainability; technology","decision making; environmental impact; environmental issue; innovation; manufacturing; sustainability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140635093"

It is exactly the promotion of innovation that has become the cornerstone of economic transformation. Given the high barrier to entry, the role of different forms of business support has increased significantly. These changes and rapid growth have influenced the development of business incubation, which has led to the development of various support mechanisms, such as co-working spaces, accelerators, early-stage investment funds, etc. In response to the market demand, there has been exponential growth in the number of business incubators with the aim of exponentially increasing their value and impact on the economy, while the value of business incubators is exponentially decreasing due to uncertain evaluation of their impact. In this regard, it is essential to classify business incubators reflecting on their different operating models, purpose and performance metrics, and their potential impact on the economy or other systems. © 2023 Proceedings of World Multi-Conference on Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics, WMSCI.

A research project conducted on the Cooperative Research Centres—Projects (CRC-P) Program in Australia found that, in a number of cases, secondary and tertiary outcomes were highly valued by participants, and provided important but hitherto officially unacknowledged socio-economic benefits to the Australian NSI. This discussion proposes a typology of collaborative research outcomes beyond traditional compliance-based metrics, and challenges policy makers and research and innovation administrators to consider the development of an ‘Innovation Ecosystem Body of Knowledge’ to inform future collaborative research projects and enhance the ability of actors to access this ecosystem in an efficient and productive manner in order to ensure that potential economic gains from collaborative research are maximised. © 2022 The Authors.

Given the current threat of climate change, we must develop new products that not only maximise the circularity of resources but also minimise climate change impacts. While these two goals are usually aligned, trade-offs exist. For instance, recycling biobased asphalt is a better end-of-life option than landfilling from a resource efficiency perspective. However, landfilling of biogenic non-biodegradable material leads to permanent carbon storage and, therefore, climate benefits. To fully understand the potential benefits and impacts of biobased circular innovations, we need metrics to capture their complexity from both a circular and climate point of view. This study explores the use of different circularity and sustainability metrics to understand the impacts and trade-offs of lignin-based versus bitumen-based asphalts. The analysis is done by calculating the Material Circularity Index (MCI) and two newly developed indicators quantifying the biogenic carbon storage (BCS) of products (BCS100 and c-BCS) while following the CE principles. In addition, the impacts regarding climate change, life cycle costs and ECI (environmental costs indicator) are also provided. Based on the MCI, it can be concluded that lignin-based asphalt roads have slightly higher material circularity than their bitumen-based counterparts. The BCS analysis indicated that the least circular lignin-based alternative sequesters the highest amount of carbon in the long term due to permanent storage in foundations. Despite these trade-offs, the results from the newly developed BCS indicators allowed to align both climate and circularity goals, guiding policymakers and industry actors to implement circular biobased strategies where the value of biobased materials is optimised. Finally, this article discusses the use of different circularity and environmental metrics for decision making in the context of a circular biobased economy. © 2022 The Authors","Asphalt; Biobased; Biogenic carbon; Circular economy; Lignin; Metrics","Asphalt; Commerce; Costs; Decision Making; Life Cycle; Asphalt; Climate change; Commerce; Costs; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Life cycle; Lignin; Storage (materials); Sustainable development; Bio-based; Bio-based products; Biogenic carbon; Biogenics; Carbon storage; Circular economy; Landfilling; Metric; Policy makers; Trade off; Decision making","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140808394"

History shows that the difference between a mineral deposit's economic status and its uneconomic status lies in the mining technological innovation most prevalent in each phase of technological development. The significance of mining technology is that it curbs the negative impact of mineral deposit depletion by improving productivity, thereby keeping mineral exploitation profitable. This relationship makes it imperative to develop a framework that utilises this concept to sustain mining in the future. The framework will incorporate the benefits of technological innovation implementation to demonstrate its impact on a company's share price. It will help public investors understand share price performance while serving as an additional internal new technology investment approval tool. This paper demonstrates how applying technological development and innovation affects mining processes and its economics. This relationship is evident throughout the four historical mining technological stages, which started in the 18th Century with mechanisation, then remote control, automation, and currently, autonomous technology systems. At each stage, the need for a more productive technology arose as the effects of mineral resources depletion threatened mining's profitability. Thus, it can be judged that the future of mining profitability lies in the current advanced technologies that leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning systems. Nonetheless, while mineral commodity miners profit and firm market values grow, the growth is not empirically linked to the technological innovation development that drives it. Conversely, in other industries, the firm's technological development innovation resultant economic metrics, along with macroeconomic factors, are captured and empirically linked to stock market value. This exposes a gap in the financial impact evaluation of mining technology innovation implementation. Therefore, this paper explores the possibility of developing that framework for the mining industry by identifying improved productivity and cost metrics, profit margin growth, and the resultant share price performance. © 2023 The Authors","Autonomous haulage system; Mining costs; Mining technological innovation; Productivity; Stock market value","Commerce; Costs; Engineering education; Financial markets; Investments; Learning systems; Mineral resources; Minerals; Mining industry; Profitability; Remote control; Autonomous haulage system; Haulage system; Market values; Mining cost; Mining technological innovation; Mining technology; Share price; Stock market value; Technological development; Technological innovation; automation; innovation; mining; productivity; stock market; Mining","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165535970"

The Porter hypothesis posits that environmental regulations can effectively promote innovation. However, with the rapid development of the Internet, the relationship between environmental regulation and innovation has changed. Through a theoretical analysis, this paper finds that the development of the Internet can not only directly promote innovation but also inhibit innovation through environmental regulations. This paper uses Chinese city-level data from 2014 to 2016 to empirically test the relationship among the Internet, environmental regulation, and innovation. The study finds that (1) the increase in the Internet level and in the intensity of environmental regulations promotes innovation, and the results remain stable after the replacement of the Internet level metrics, (2) the increase in the Internet level inhibits the positive effect of environmental regulations on innovation, but its inhibitory effect is lower than the promotion effect of the Internet on innovation, and (3) the Internet and environmental regulations have a significant promotion effect on the application and acquisition of three types of patents, including invention patents, utility model patents and design patents, with the application and acquisition of utility model patents having the greatest promotion effect, and (4) the analysis of heterogeneity shows that environmental regulation has a greater effect on innovation in eastern and provincial capital cities, and the Internet has a greater effect on innovation in western and nonprovincial capital cities. Finally, this article puts forward policy recommendations based on three aspects: strengthening Internet construction, implementing environmental regulations and policies based on local conditions, and increasing support for R&D and innovation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","China; Environmental regulation; Innovation; Internet","China; environmental policy; environmental protection; innovation; Internet; policy implementation; theoretical study","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137029241"

Battery heating is a viable way to address this issue, and self-heating techniques are appealing due to acceptable efficiency and speed. However, there are a lack of studies quantitatively comparing self-heating methods rather than qualitatively, because of the existence of many different batteries with varied heating parameters. In this work, we review the current state-of-the-art self-heating methods and propose the heating triangle as a new quantitative indicator for comparing self-heating methods, towards identifying/developing effective heating approaches. We define the heating triangle which considers three fundamental metrics: the specific heating rate (°C·g·J−1), coefficient of performance (COP) (−), and specific temperature difference (°C·hr), enabling a quantitative assessment of self-heating methods using data reported in the literature. Our analysis demonstrates that very similar metrics are observed for the same type of self-heating method, irrespective of the study case, supporting the universality of the proposed indicator. With the comparison insights, we identify research gaps and new avenues for developing advanced self-heating methods. This work demonstrates the value of the proposed heating triangle as a standardised approach to compare heating methods and drive innovation. © 2023 The Authors","lithium-ion battery; Low temperature; Metrics; Preheating; Self-heating; Thermal management","Digital storage; Ions; Temperature; Temperature control; 'current; Available energy; Available power; Battery heating; Heating method; Heating parameters; Lows-temperatures; Metric; Self-heating; State of the art; Lithium-ion batteries","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168835111"

Our concern is that of moderating the environmental burden and intensity of this metabolism and elevating its “circularity” through technological interventions in the composition of urban infrastructure. The paper addresses present and possible future patterns of the nitrogen (N) metabolism of Suzhou, China, using a Multi-sectoral Systems Analysis (MSA) model of the water, energy, food, forestry, and waste management sectors of the city's infrastructure and economy. Two of the Triple Bottom Lines are employed in the assessment: those of the economic feasibility and the environmental benignity of the technological interventions. Environmental benignity is gauged by three Metabolic Performance Metrics (MPMs). 15 scenarios of these interventions are assessed, each being a different combination of introducing four particular promising technologies. The MPMs allow ranking of the scenarios according to, first, the ratio of incoming resource flows into the city and outgoing socio-economically beneficial products and, second, the rates at which “wastes” of no value are released to the atmosphere (as air pollutants), hydrosphere (water pollutants), and the lithosphere (solid wastes). The economic feasibility of the options can similarly be ranked according to the monetary values of resources (such as clean water or energy) that are saved by lowered urban consumption or that are recovered (such as biofuels or fertilizer) for beneficial re-circulation and re-use. All four candidate technological innovations are associated with the water and waste management sectors of urban infrastructure. We show that the trio of urine-separating technology, cultivation of algal biomass in wastewater treatment, and pyrolysis of animal manure can achieve an expected net annual economic benefit of 1.4B Yuan, together with the potential to recover some 31 Gg N yr−1. Notably, our computational assessment accounts for uncertainty, using Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity testing. In particular, we examine how uncertainty may significantly undermine the conclusions we may draw about the promise of any given technological innovation vis à vis another alternative. © 2023","Circular economy; Data uncertainty; Resource recovery; Technological innovation; Urban nitrogen metabolism; Water-energy-food nexus","China; Jiangsu; Suzhou; Economic and social effects; Fertilizers; Hydrosphere; Intelligent systems; Metabolism; Nitrogen; Recovery; Systems analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Wastewater treatment; Water pollution; Circular economy; Data uncertainty; Economic feasibilities; Nitrogen metabolism; Resource recovery; Technological innovation; Urban infrastructure; Urban nitrogen metabolism; Water energy; Water-energy-food nexus; infrastructure; innovation; metabolism; nitrogen compound; socioeconomic conditions; uncertainty analysis; Monte Carlo methods","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147090215"

While competition authorities have commenced exploring pathways to excuse prima facie anticompetitive mergers on sustainability grounds, little progress has been made in setting out whether and under which conditions mergers that adversely affect sustainability parameters can be found anticompetitive. Under the EU merger control regime, the adverse effects of mergers on sustainability are only cognizable as innovation-related issues, as recently evidenced in Dow/Dupont and Bayer/Monsanto. In these cases, the Commission pioneered a novel approach aimed at predicting the impact of a merger not only on prices but also on innovation competition. This theory of harm, although a welcome improvement to the current framework of merger analysis, fails to accommodate all competition-relevant sustainability concerns because of its exclusive focus on innovation capabilities, efforts, and output. On this basis, we argue that innovation competition should not be understood only as an output-maximizing device but also as a polycentric process under which independent decision-makers pursue various innovation paths. Such an approach gives prominence to the diversity, quality, and direction of innovation and constitutes an alternative to the predominant output-centred understanding of innovation. To operationalize this notion of innovation competition as a polycentric process we explore four pathways: adopting quality-related and sustainability-sensitive innovation metrics; using indicators of industry-wide structural effects; endorsing a structural filter; and protecting nascent competitors. Adding such an approach to the existing analytical framework would, arguably, enable the Commission to deal with all sustainability concerns related to the notion of innovation competition.  © 2022 The Author(s).

These regulations are ideally customized to meet water-specific stock dynamics and fishery objectives. However, in districts with numerous discrete waters, fisheries are commonly managed with a universal regional regulation. Evaluating alternative regional length limits requires consideration of management objectives that may not be important at the single-system level but that emerge as relevant at the regional scale, such as uniformity of regional harvest, diversity of average catch sizes, and opportunity to harvest. We developed a flexible tool for evaluating regional length limits. The tool joins the well-established Beverton–Holt yield-per-recruit model with elements of decision-support methods. The model quantifies regional management objectives as utility functions that are weighted and summed into a single value used to evaluate alternative length limits. The flexibility of the tool stems from its capacity to consider a mixture of stock parameters and associated uncertainty to evaluate multiple length limits, weighting an array of regional fishery objectives quantified by various performance metrics. This adjustability affords flexibility to consider a diversity of options that can stimulate innovation in setting regional length limits. We demonstrate the model by evaluating varying length limits on fishery objectives related to the management of hypothetical yellow perch (Perca flavescens) populations and real black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus) populations. © 2023 The U.S. Government.","Beverton–Holt; decision support; harvest model; harvest regulations; structured decision-making; yield-per-recruit","array; decision support system; fishery; fishery management; freshwater environment; innovation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168872183"

In mapping out these relationships we identify how the importance of different change worldviews varies across contexts, with Balance most critical for understanding support for sustainability, Progress/Golden Age important for understanding responses to innovations, and Golden Age uniquely important for preferring Trump/Republicans in the 2016 US election. These relationships were independent of prominent individual differences (e.g., values, political orientation for elections) or context-specific factors (e.g., self-reported innovativeness for responses to innovations).

To explore sustainability more comprehensively in this context, this paper improves the inclusive wealth (IW) system proposed by the United Nations Environment Programme by extending the definition of intangible capital and refining the classification of different types of capital. We then used the advanced IWI to investigate the changes in per capita IW and its capital composition in China's 10 National Sustainable Development Agenda Innovation Demonstration Zones from 2010 to 2019, and proposed sustainable development pathways for Chinese cities. Our results underline the fact that IW and capital structure across different types of cities is highly variable. The growth of IW per capita in Shenzhen, an international metropolis, mainly depends on advanced produced capital and intangible capital. For Ordos, however—a resource-rich “energy city”—the per capita IW is driven by ordinary produced capital and restricted by non-renewable natural capital, thus showing a low level of sustainability. Through its consideration of four kinds of capital, this study also points out the inequality of human capital between urban-rural and male-female groups, and demonstrates how increasing educational attainment helps to promote the transfer of human capital between regions and sectors. In general, a strong potential for sustainable development is linked to the promotion of highly educated human capital, advanced produced capital and intangible capital, while the ecosystem service value of natural capital is also key. © 2022.

This article argues that despite the arguments about disruptions to governance and policy due to AI, the global rankings increasingly constitute a strong path dependence on AI policy, leading to conformity with existing policies and institutional practices of economic competitiveness. By analyzing the composition and data sources of global indices in competitiveness, innovation, human capital, and artificial intelligence, I will show how the global rankings now evolve by sharing data and concepts. Consequently, these metrics and related policy scripts promote the seeming continuity of current activities of global competitiveness. AI is discussed as a “revolution” but framed as a matter of “competitiveness,” “openness,” and “talent competition,” implying standard perceptions of economic competitiveness and innovation. There is also a narrative element in the policy script, as the future policies on AI are promoted with references to history that also project the past into the future. My article concludes that while path-dependent policy indicators and related future narratives give a sense of orientation, they are problematic as they portray a seeming continuity of activities in times of disruptions, delimiting policy alternatives such as AI ethics. © 2023 The Author.

However, their formulation is generally derived from simple statistical models (e.g., multiple linear regression) and are not optimised globally. In this paper, we present a simple framework for optimising genesis indexes given a user-specified trade-off between two performance metrics, which measure how well an index captures the spatial and interannual variability of tropical cyclone genesis. We apply the proposed framework to the popular Emanuel and Nolan Genesis Potential Index, yielding new, optimised formulas that correspond to different trade-offs between spatial and interannual variability. Result show that our refined indexes can improve the performance of the Emanuel and Nolan index up to 8% for spatial variability and 16%-22% for interannual variability; this improvement was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.01).

This year's conference theme “Out with the old, in with the new!” was discussed and presented in keynote speeches, the APE lecture, and several panel discussions. Current challenges within scholarly publishing, e.g., with research integrity, trust, and research assessment, have much to do with the old ways of doing things. To move science forward, new technologies and innovations, like the decentralized web, FAIR digital objects, and blockchain technology are needed to shape new paradigms. In many sessions it was stressed that not just new technologies are needed to move science forward, but human collaboration and partnerships as well. The changing role of the journal and the importance to recognize more diverse research outputs, beyond the journal article, was a topic of importance. Not only research assessment reforms and improved collaboration amongst different stakeholder groups are needed to address this, new publishing systems, better metadata, and open infrastructures as well. A session presenting different start-ups showcased how Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing and software technology can be used to tackle problems in e.g., finding relevant funders and peer reviewers, and detecting image plagiarism. It was also discussed what publishers can do to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Collaboration, data transparency and sharing best practices amongst researchers, funders, and policy makers are key. Another important topic during this year's APE was how publishers can support Early Career Researchers: establishing new workflows and infrastructures that enable publication of a wider range of research outputs, and broader recognition of these outputs, will incentivize ECRs. This year's APE was concluded with the APE Award Ceremony. The winner - Vsevolod Solovyov from Prophy - has used AI to enhance the current peer review system and made a very important contribution to improving the scholarly communication system. © 2024 - The authors.

Economic development zones are exclusive spaces, representing the intimate connection between political authority and urbanization. The imbalanced spatial development of China’s economy leads to transfer of industries among different regions of Anhui province. This inter-regional transferring of industries is not only reflecting the dynamic changes of factor endowments among the regions but also an important way to promote the development of under-developed regions. The Wanjiang Demonstration Area (WDA) was selected to undertake industrial transfer, and it results in industrial transfer rely on synergistic effect of technology and local talent. This study analyzed the synergistic effect of technology and local talent of WDA industry transfer by using entropy value method and coupling coordination degree model based on discussing the talent factors that influence the technical level. The result indicates that talent level index (66,190.23, Uj) is much higher than technology level index (1793.65, Ui); coordination degrees of technology and talent in WDA with the values ranging from 0.09 to 2.16 were found and also manifesting low coupling coordination and system imbalance. As per the coupling method, synergistic effects of technology and talent of industry transfer in WDA are basically in a low coupling stage, and the coupling degree ranges were from 0.10 to 0.19. There were regional variations in the metrics that measure talent and technology including (composite index, coupling degree and coordination degree). All indices in the Hefei city are much greater than those in other nearby areas; with the exception of the coupling degree, in resulting regional barriers should be avoided and unrestricted exchanges of talent and technology should be encouraged. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Coupling model; Industrial transfer; Research and innovation; Synergistic effects; Talent; Technology; Wanjiang Demonstration Area (WDA)","Anhui; China; Hefei; economic development; economic growth; innovation; political economy; sustainable development; technology transfer; urbanization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139717346"

Methods: Here, this question is investigated as follows: Various novel proxy metrics of regulation (FDA-issued guidelines) and innovation (corresponding FDA-registrations) from 1976–2020 are used to determine interdependence, a concept relying on strong correlation and reciprocal causality (estimated via variable lag transfer entropy and wavelet coherence). Results: Based on the observed interdependence, a mapping of regulation onto innovation is conducted and finds that regulation seems to accelerate then supports innovation until on or around 2015; at which time, an inverted U-curve emerged. Conclusions: If empirically evidentiary, an important innovation-regulation nexus in the US has been reached; and, as such, stakeholders should (re)consider the complexity of the regulatory landscape to enhance US medical product innovation.

A novel data recorder connected to a robotic-assisted surgical platform captures synchronized kinematic and video data during an operation to calculate quantitative, objective performance indicators (OPIs). The aim of this study was to determine if OPIs during initial task of a resident’s robotic-assisted lobectomy (RL) correlated with bleeding during the procedure. Forty-six residents from the 2019 Thoracic Surgery Directors Association Resident Boot Camp completed RL on an ex vivo perfused porcine model while continuous video and kinematic data were recorded. For this pilot study, RL was segmented into 12 tasks and OPIs were calculated for the initial major task. Cases were reviewed for major bleeding events and OPIs of bleeding cases were compared to those who did not. Data from 42 residents were complete and included in the analysis. 10/42 residents (23.8%) encountered bleeding: 10/40 residents who started with superior pulmonary vein exposure and 0/2 residents who started with pulmonary artery exposure. Twenty OPIs for both hands were assessed during the initial task. Six OPIs related to instrument usage or smoothness of motion were significant for bleeding. Differences were statistically significant for both hands (p < 0.05). OPIs showing bimanual asymmetry indicated lower proficiency. This study demonstrates that kinematic and video analytics can establish a correlation between objective performance metrics and bleeding events in an ex vivo perfused lobectomy. Further study could assist in the development of focused exercises and simulation on objective domains to help improve overall performance and reducing complications during RL. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Innovation; Robotic surgery; Simulation; Surgical data science; Surgical education; Technical assessment","Animals; Clinical Competence; Humans; Internship and Residency; Pilot Projects; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Surgeons; Swine; Thoracic Surgical Procedures; Vascular System Injuries; Kinematics; Robotic surgery; Surgical equipment; Bleedings; Innovation; Kinematic data; Performance indicators; Porcine models; Robotics surgery; Simulation; Surgical data science; Surgical education; Technical assessment; acceleration; animal experiment; animal model; artery dissection; Article; blood vessel injury; bronchus dissection; cardiothoracic resident; comparative study; dissection; ex vivo study; human; kinematics; lobectomy; lymph node dissection; lymphoid tissue; median jerk; mediastinum lymph node; movement arrest period ratio; nonhuman; objective performance indicator; operation duration; operative blood loss; performance indicator; pilot study; porcine model; pulmonary artery; pulmonary vein; resident; robot assisted surgery; spectral arc length; superior pulmonary vein; surgical training; thorax surgery; tissue interaction; tissue perfusion; vein dissection; velocity; videorecording; virtual reality; wrist angle distance; wrist angle median speed; animal; blood vessel injury; clinical competence; medical education; pig; procedures; surgeon; thorax surgery; Benchmarking","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140839260"

The authors theorize and show that a firm's innovation potential—firm outputs and activities that contribute to the development of future new products—can be used by the managers of IPO firms as a credible signal of the quality of the firm. Using a sample of 370 IPO firms from the consumer-packaged goods and pharmaceutical industries, and three metrics of innovation potential, the authors show that firms’ innovation potential is (1) positively associated with the initial value of the IPO and with the first-day IPO returns and (2) negatively associated with the extent to which insiders sell their shares at the time of the IPO. The effectiveness of the three metrics of innovation potential as a signal of firm quality varies: patents have a stronger impact on insider sales than preannouncements and generic references to future innovation, while preannouncements have the strongest impact on first-day IPO returns. The article presents a nuanced view of the extent to which various firm stakeholders consider information about firms’ innovation potential to be a credible signal that reduces the adverse selection present in IPO deals with insider sales. © American Marketing Association 2023.","innovation; insider sales; IPO; IPO first-day returns; patents; preannouncements","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147440661"

As in many areas of organizational life, errors in measuring innovation are a recurring fact. Innovation researchers and practitioners alike have become increasingly interested in understanding the occurrence of organizational errors and how these errors affect innovation and its measurement. This empirical study aims to address this under-explored area by utilizing a qualitative in-depth case study at the innovation department of an organization with production sites and sales organizations worldwide. A total of 28 semi-structured interviews at several organizational levels were conducted, with innovation managers, project managers, senior managers, and staff. Based on the findings in this case study, three explanations are presented on how organizational errors occur when using innovation KPIs (key performance indicators). The first explanation can be connected to the increasing complexity of innovation and its intangible nature. Another explanation can be traced to the difference between innovation strategy and innovation KPIs. Lastly, room for organizational errors can be related to the multitude of individuals and organizational levels involved in innovation and its measurement. The implications for practitioners are that innovation KPIs are not precise metrics but should be seen as estimates with organizational errors. Whether or not these innovation KPIs can be used as tools to turn innovation into competitive advantages largely depends on whether wrong is right. Future research should focus on the metrics that are implemented and actually in use, as this future path would highlight the function and dysfunction that organizational errors in innovation KPIs can have. © 2021 by the author.","innovation; key performance metrics (KPIs); organizational errors; performance measurement","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130111853"

However, firm interactions also generate market rivalry. Unlike knowledge spillovers, we know little over the geographic reach of market rivalry. The paper aims to provide a rigorous comparison of these two channels in a large scale. It approximates knowledge spillovers with the staple metric of patent citations. For market rivalry, the metric of trademark oppositions is proposed. The baseline analysis is at the EUIPO, for trademark oppositions, and EPO for patent citations. The country level and NUTS-3 analyses show that there is stronger home bias for knowledge spillovers compared to market rivalry. To provide robustness, similar data are computed for the USPTO, the most populous patent and trademark office in the world, and an office with substantially fewer trademark oppositions due to its different procedures. State- and county-level analyses provide similar results to the baseline analysis. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","","comparative study; economic growth; innovation; market system; spillover effect; travel behavior","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100487320"

However, there is still a gap regarding the definition of variables that could be used as production and innovation indicators for this sector. As such, we propose the use of trademark registers as indicators of the production and introduction of new goods and services in segments related to this sector. First, we provide a descriptive analysis of United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) trademark registration data throughout the twentieth century. This analysis allows us to see that the trademarks registered in segments aligned with the creative and cultural industries have shown strong expansion, especially since the 1980s, which can be related to the technological and economic changes observed in the global market in this period. This movement is observable especially among the most technology-intensive segments, such as the production of software, digital games and music. Second, we analyse the factors associated with trademark registration in the period covered using ordinary least square estimates. The main results show that patent registration and revenue (a proxy for size) are strongly associated with trademark registration for companies in the creative economy. On the other hand, location in a developed country is not a determinant of the registration of trademarks in the sector, in contrast to the results obtained for the whole set of firms. In the case of low-tech firms in the creative economy, only revenue explains the registration of trademarks. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Creative economy; innovation; O31; trademarks; USPTO; Z10","","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133585420"

A systematic analysis of existing WEF nexus frameworks in academic and gray literature resulted in the development of a South African framework that considers the three sectors as well as technological innovation, human well-being, the SDGs, and different drivers of the WEF nexus.

To incentivize such transitions, governments provide subsidies to private and public companies to innovate, i.e., to engage in research and development (R&D) to develop those technologies. However, the question of the companies is using government subsidies (GS) to perform R&D and its answer determines the effectiveness of government policies. Consequently, this paper seeks to answer this question through investigating Chinese lithium-ion battery (LiB) firms and the GS they receive through novel usage of information flow (IF). Hausman tests, fixed-and random-effects models confirmed a weak, though positive correlation between GS and R&D as determined by patent output (PO), but interestingly, observations of IF intimated that GS also affected other variables such as net profit (NP) and main business income (MBI). This suggests that firms are being awarded GS for higher PO, but a corresponding increase in R&D and its expected growth in company performance is not occurring. Thus, it is suggested that performance variables other than PO be used as firms may ab (use) this metric to apply for more GS, rather than performing R&D that leads to technological breakthroughs. © 2021 by the authors.

Consequently, a tremendous amount of energy is consumed with high carbon dioxide emissions, which necessitates that cloud service providers (CSP) develop high quality of service (QoS) strategies to address such challenges. Proper management and utilization of resources ensure a well-balanced load distribution that makes energy consumption sufficient. Developing new algorithms and exploring efficient methods and techniques is highly desired for the management of virtualized DCs. This research proposes Finite Automata using Ant Colony Optimization with Spanning Tree (FAACOST), a machine-learning concept for managing cloud resources in a multi-tier environment. The overall objective is to minimize energy consumption through data placement leverage and virtual machines (VM) consolidation. The proposed technique's efficiency was benchmarked on four performance metrics (machine learning, dynamic nature, scalability, and QoS). Based on the extensive experiments conducted, FAACOST recorded an energy consumption of 132 w with 20 tasks compared to the benchmarked techniques that consumed 363 w. The experimental results show that FAACOST achieves the optimal number of physical machines (PMs) and is more energy-efficient. © 2021","Bio-inspired; Cloud computing; Energy efficiency; Finite automata; Metaheuristic technique; Resource provisioning","Ant colony optimization; Carbon dioxide; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Finite automata; Global warming; Machine learning; Robots; Turing machines; Cloud service providers; Computational resources; Dynamic nature; Energy efficient; Large scale data; Management and utilization; Optimal number; Performance metrics; energy efficiency; heuristics; innovation; numerical model; optimization; technological change; technological development; Quality of service","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099633516"

Previous studies correlate innovation performance with cultural diversity of teams, but note that team dynamics need to be optimized to derive maximum benefit. Herein, this study offers an assessment of available team building instruments through the lens of diverse innovation teams. In a demonstration project in the pharmaceutical industry, this study then outlines specific tools and approaches which can be successfully deployed through team coaching and mentoring. Design/methodology/approach: A cluster of nine innovation teams with varying degrees of cultural diversity was provided with assessment and management instruments which had been identified and field tested by a mentoring team. Content included cultural awareness tools, innovation team profiling methods and Team Science (SciTS) ideology. Teams were funded, coached and mentored through a six-month performance period and assessed at regular intervals. Findings: Team assessments provided correlations between performance (measured by project completion and new intellectual property generated) and diversity together with wealth of information on intra-team culture and dynamics. Concrete recommendations from the study include adoption of appropriate communication standards to promote inclusivity, use of SciTS operational tracking metrics to enhance engagement, use of the FourSight group profiling methodology and cultural quotient scale cultural awareness instruments at team-forming stage to promote effective dynamics and enhance inclusivity. Practical implications: Cultural diversity has a positive impact on innovation teams. This said, for maximum benefit cultural awareness of team members should be optimized to avoid unintended conflicts developing. Such issues can be exacerbated when teams are deployed remotely and preventative measures should be established. These issues became of heightened significance as a result of telecommuting imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and have longer-term implications, as corporations consider global air travel reduction through environmental concerns. A tracking tool is described to monitor team engagement and promote inclusivity. It is expected that the learnings can influence how teams can best form, normalize and operate within corporate innovation programs and form the basis of long-term impact studies. Originality/value: This represents the first systematic study on the impact of cultural diversity and team dynamics within innovation programs in the pharmaceutical industry. The tools and methodologies deployed are widely available and can be adopted by innovation teams in many adjacent industries with established innovation ecosystems. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Assessment; Culture; Diversity; Ideation; Implementation; Inclusion; Innovation; Team science","Dynamics; Communication standards; Corporate innovation; Demonstration project; Design/methodology/approach; Environmental concerns; Innovation performance; Pharmaceutical industry; Wealth of information; Human resource management","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100734383"

Social distancing and stay-at-home orders leave businesses and cities wondering how future economic activity moves forward. The reduction in face-to-face interactions creates an impetus to understand how social interactivity influences economic efficiency and rates of innovation. Here, we create a measure of the degree to which a workforce engages in social interactions, analyzing its relationships to economic innovation and efficiency. We do this by decomposing U.S. occupations into individual work activities, determining which of those activities are associated with face-to-face interactions. We then re-aggregate the labor forces of U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) into a metric of urban social interactiveness. Using a novel measure of urbanized area, we then calculate each MSA’s density of social work activities. We find that our metric of urban socialness is positively correlated with a city’s per worker patent production. Furthermore, we use our set of social work activities to reaggregate the workforces of U.S. industries into a metric of industry social interactivness, finding that this measure scales superlinearly with an industry’s per worker GDP. Together, the results suggest that social interaction among workers is an important driver of both a city’s rate of invention and an industry’s economic efficiency. Finally, we briefly highlight analogies between cities and stars and discuss their potential to guide further research, vis-à-vis the density of social interactions “igniting” a city or industry. © 2021 by the authors.","COVID-19; economic impact; innovation; labor dynamics; sociality; urban density","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120434584"

The methodology provides a consistent hierarchy of performance metrics relevant to the given system of reference, design activity and development stage under consideration as a means to scrutinise wave energy requirements. Full traceability of system requirements and performance metrics is then facilitated by multi-criteria decision tools and aggregation logic, respectively.

Additional analysis suggests that when a city's air pollution is comparatively worse than other cities', a firm in the highly polluted city: 1) has tighter financial constraints, which leads it to invest less in research and development or to increase its environmental investment (crowding-out effect), and 2) attracts fewer technical, highly educated, and foreign-experienced employees (human capital effect).

However, current solutions incorporate animals mainly passively, e.g. by measuring their health status and predicting their behavior. This approach neglects that animals are able to signal their needs actively and can thus provide information about their environment and cooperate in management tasks. The key to unlock this potential is to establish bidirectional communication between animals and machines. This can be achieved by automatically condition animals to show stimulus-controlled operant behavior. However, this automation of animal learning requires metrics for the learning progress that are applicable in a variety of contexts. We show that the current learning metrics are not transferable in this regard and propose a normalized precision metric as an alternative. This metric was utilized to analyze the learning performance of adult sows in an exemplary signal discrimination task, set in three fundamentally different training conditions. The results demonstrate that the normalized precision metric is unaffected by differences in the distribution of learned events. Moreover, it fulfills basic plausibility criteria for the assessment of animal learning that are not satisfied by other metrics, such as comparable start and end values under different conditions. This provides the precondition for a broader utilization of cooperative livestock farming - a new form of integrating animals in management tasks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Animal learning; Animal-computer interaction; Cooperative livestock farming; Operant conditioning; Precision livestock farming","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Automation; 'current; Animal learning; Animal-computer interactions; Animal-robot interaction; Condition; Cooperative livestock farming; Livestock farming; Management tasks; Operant conditioning; Precision livestock farming; automation; communication; health status; innovation; livestock farming; machinery; performance assessment; precision; robotics; training; Animals","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117414041"

If the predominant perception holds that the speed of innovation is sluggish, pressure for changes in the regulatory environment intensifies. Methods: A systematic evaluation of the course of innovation in this industry was performed by applying a formula derived from economic market share theory to estimate the innovative contribution of each new molecular entity approved since 1938. The total and average innovation scores per year are described based on the therapeutic class, mechanism, and drug target. These data are compared to the number and percent of first-in-class drugs per year. Results: The average annual score based on therapeutic class novelty has been declining; however, the therapeutic class total innovation score has been stable since the mid-1970s with occasional significant peaks of activity. While the average score based on mechanism or target experienced a decline beginning in the 1950s and 1960s, it has begun to rise since the early 1990s. Notably, the total innovation score has steadily increased since the 1970s. These variations closely parallel the number of first-in-class drugs approved on an annual basis. Conclusions: While the reasons underlying these activities are likely complex, there is a temporal association between regulatory efforts to expedite drug development and approval. These findings should be considered when considering future incentivizing regulations and policies. © 2020, The Drug Information Association, Inc.","Biotechnology; Business cycle; Drug development; Innovation; Pharmaceutical","Drug Industry; Forecasting; Pharmaceutical Preparations; drug; Article; drug approval; drug industry; priority journal; scoring system; spike; forecasting","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090057305"

The interactions between different sectors in a territory are still not easily observable. We test the complexity of the economic structure at a local level, given the availability of data at a very granular scale. This could greatly assist in observing sectors or/and locations that play a dominant role in the regional economy. Thus, in order to interpret the economic structure of a territory, we used cluster-based analysis. The analysis helps in evaluating the interconnections among sectors that constitute a cluster. A novel method of describing the territorial economic structure is presented by applying Social Network Analysis (SNA) within cluster-based analysis to characterize the importance of both location and economic interconnections. In this study, we focus on the industrial agglomerations in Calabria, Italy, to underpin the potential of the region’s industries by using social networking analysis metrics. This research put forward new interpretations of SNA metrics that describe regional economic compositions. Our findings reveal that territorial social networks are a potential instrument for understanding interactions in regional systems and economic clusters and might help in highlighting local industrial potentials.

The first attempts to conceptualize and define the U.S. bioeconomy began in the early 1990s. This was followed by a series of government and private efforts to develop methods to understand and evaluate it and to develop programs to promote it. These efforts culminated in the 2020 release of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), Safeguarding the Bioeconomy report. The report recommended a formal definition of the U.S. bioeconomy, providing the rationale for that particular definition in the U.S. con-text. Formally adopting a comprehensive definition of the U.S. bioeconomy would enable the U.S. government to better assess the bioeconomy’s current state, to develop strategies to support its growth, and to promote strategies to safeguard it. Along with this recommendation, the NASEM Safeguarding report also discussed defining the “bioeconomy landscape,” which involves more pre-cise determination and quantification of which economic activities are part of and external to the U.S. economy. Defining this landscape could guide metric development and data collection needed to track the bioeconomy’s growth, conduct economic assessments, and enable policy makers to keep abreast of advances that could potentially pose new national or economic security challenges. The report also includes an analysis of the broad range national bioeconomy strategies, identification of the four drivers of the U.S. bioeconomy, and the first of its kind, comprehensive estimate of the size and scope of the U.S. bioeconomy of USD 959B (valued in 2016 constant USD ). © 2021 by the authors.

An understanding of when one or more external factors may influence the evolution of innovation tracking indices (such as US patent and trademark applications (PTA)) is an important aspect of examining economic progress/ regress. Using exploratory statistics, the analysis uses a novel tool to leverage the long-range dependency (LRD) intrinsic to PTA to resolve when such factor(s) may have caused significant disruptions in the evolution of the indices, and thus give insight into substantive economic growth dynamics. Design/Methodology/Approach. This paper explores the use of the Chronological Hurst Exponent (CHE) to explore the LRD using overlapping time windows to quantify long-memory dynamics in the monthly PTA time series spanning 1977 to 2016. Results/Discussion. The CHE is found to increase in a clear S-curve pattern, achieving persistence (H~1) from non-persistence (H~0.5). For patents, the inflection occurred over a span of 10 years (1980-1990), while it was much sharper (3 years) for trademarks (1977-1980). Conclusions/Originality/Value. This analysis suggests (in part) that the rapid augmentation in R&D expenditure and the introduction of the various patent-directed policy acts (e.g., Bayh-Dole, Stevenson-Wydler) are the key factors behind persistency, latent in PTA. The post-1990’s exogenic factors seem to be simply maintaining the high degree and consistency of the persistency metric. These findings suggest investigators should consider latent persistency when using these data and the CHE may be an important tool to investigate the impact of substantive exogenous variables on growth dynamics. © 2021 Daizadeh.","economy; Hurst; Innovation; patents; persistency; trademarks","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141407206"

The analysis reveals distinctive rates of innovation for each vertical, with some slowing down, as innovation becomes standardized and mainstream, and others peaking up, stemming from developments in other fields of science. Results are treated with respect to the S-curve technology maturity framework which accounts for effort and time towards development and the widely adopted scale of technology readiness levels.

This study aims to investigate the issue, marshalling data on the economic dimension, to better understand the environments of APIs. It offers an overview of the functions and definition of application programming interfaces (APIs) in the backdrop of the history of services computing. The paper attempt assessing the economic value (size of the market) of APIs and reviews some of the available metrics. The paper also takes a look some issues and challenges ahead for the deployment of all kind of APIs. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on desk research and a scientific and grey literature review. However, it relies mostly on specialized consultancies although from a critical viewpoint. The paper provides an historical account of the notions of APIs and API economy. Findings: The paper questions the idea of an “API economy” that still stands on the “hype” side and is not clearly substantiated. It reveals that the number of firms with mature API programs remains small and that there is an uneven development across industries (traditional firms are less active than digital natives) and countries (Silicon Valley is leading). It highlights that the domination of IT companies (leaders and pioneers of APIs) raises issue of competition and at some point, may prevent rather than foster innovation. Research limitations/implications: There is no robust data about the size of the API market nor about its value. Sources are highly heterogeneous and delimitations not always precise. The standard metrics or indicators are hard to find. Further research would be needed to better document this area. Practical implications: The paper reviews some of the expected benefits of the use of APIs as enablers of private or public ecosystems. Social implications: The paper delineates some of the economic benefits of the public APIs based on open data. It shows some positive examples of public APIs in the EU. Originality/value: There is hardly any mention of the API economy in research literature. Most of the academic literature still stems from engineering department or business-management departments, not department of economics. Consultants would usually focus on the potential of business growth, on how to design an effective API strategy but not on the very economic dimension. The paper attempts providing a synthesis of the available data. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Computer applications; Computer software; Economics; Innovation; Open systems; Technology led strategy","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117230835"

Current measures do not account for changing quality nor give providers any incentive for cost-effective substitution between forms of treatment for a given condition. By leveraging existing strengths of Korea’s National Health Insurance and health outcome data, Korea can develop an accurate measure of medical productivity and a more accurate measure of overall economic productivity, while becoming a global pioneer of “health satellite accounts” for overall populations. Such a productivity metric built on condition-specific net value can help Korea increase the “bang for the buck” from medical spending, mitigate wasteful spending, and promote high-value innovations for longer, healthier lives. © 2022, East-West Population Institute.

These indirect effects were achieved through immersion experience and social influence. Subjects who watched narrative videos had a higher level of immersion experience, which in turn was significantly and positively correlated with environmental intention; meanwhile, those who watched non-narrative videos experienced a higher level of social influence, which in turn was significantly and positively correlated with environmental intention.

We estimated the exhaust emissions from the PrandtlPlane and compared the corresponding impacts to those of a conventional reference aircraft, in terms of Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Global Temperature Potential (GTP), on two time‐horizons and accounted for regional sensitivity. We considered carbon dioxide, carbonaceous and sulphate aerosols, nitrogen oxides and related ozone production, methane degradation and nitrate aerosols formation, contrails, and contrail cirrus. Overall, the introduction of the PrandtlPlane is expected to bring a considerable reduction of climate change in all the source regions considered, on both the time-horizons examined.

Environmental accounting is suggested as a condition for steadying hybrid forms and opening up possibilities for institutional innovations. This paper advances a critical social science analysis of environmental accounting to help specify how, when, and in what ways strengthening accounting capacity advances hybrid governance. Social studies of accounting argue that accounting systems are contingent on institutions: rules and social conventions, not only data or science. Our practice-centered analysis of two cases of building environmental accounting tools to advance high profile institutional innovations in US agri-environmental governance finds that the systems of rules that structure and legitimize accounting protocols are not pre-given. The same radical openness that presents opportunities for hybridity also reinforces uncertainties in building accounting standards. We identify two major frictions: a) Conventions for determining technical consensus and b) rules for determining levels of transaction costs. We conclude by identifying a need to think about hybrid forms critically. Although hybrid forms are an expression of creativity and collaboration, they are also performances of a certain contemporary political covenant that delegitimizes state-centered governance. The challenge ahead is to understand when and where hybrid arrangements add to socio-ecological regulation and where they undermine the possibility of more functional approaches through a performance of seriousness. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Accountability; Accounting; Agriculture; Climate change; Environmental governance; Metrics","Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Policy; United States; contingent valuation; environmental economics; fitness; governance approach; innovation; institutional framework; performance assessment; agriculture; article; case report; climate change; clinical article; consensus; creativity; friction; human; human experiment; hybrid; sociology; uncertainty; environmental policy; environmental protection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099858667"

Moreover, studies have extensively evaluated environmental challenges using metrics such as nitrogen oxide emissions, sulfur dioxide, carbon emissions, and ecological footprint. The environment has the supply and demand aspect, which is not a component of any of these indicators. By measuring biocapacity and ecological footprint, the load capacity factor follows a certain ecological threshold, allowing for a thorough study on environmental deterioration. With the reduction in load capacity factor, the environmental deterioration increases. In the context of the environment, the interaction between technological innovation and load capacity covers the demand and supply side of the environment. In light of this, employing the dataset ranging from 1980 to 2017 for the case of South Africa, the bound cointegration test in conjunction with the critical value of Kripfganz and Schneider showed cointegration in the model. The study also employed the ARDL, whose outcome revealed that nonrenewable energy usage and economic growth contribute to environmental deterioration, whereas technological innovation and globalization improve the quality of the environment. This study validated the hypothesis of the environmental Kuznets curve for South Africa, as the short-term coefficient value was lower than the long-term elasticity. Furthermore, using the frequency-domain causality test revealed that globalization and economic growth predict load capacity in the long term, and nonrenewable energy predicts load capacity factors in the long and medium term. In addition, technological innovation predicts load capacity factors in the short and long term. Based on the findings, we propose that policymakers should focus their efforts on increasing funding for the research and development of green technologies. © 2022 by the authors.

As they are not based on decision-theoretic approaches that involve the multiple agents that are usually embedded in innovation systems, conventional approaches are rather inadequate to generate the strategy and describe the dynamics of innovation systems. Taking a rather different approach that has been motivated by the need to generate the strategy of innovation systems, we set out a methodology that lies at the intersection of strategy, innovation and decision theory. The methodology construes the strategy of an innovation system as a process that emerges from the evaluations of agents and the aggregation logics used to arrive at a group decision. The methodology draws upon the TOPSIS multicriteria decision analysis method, uses the Mahalanobis metric of distance and applies the Borda count to aggregate the preferences of multiple agents who participate as strategists in the process of allocating resources based on a set of agreed-upon indicators. The resulting methodology can be used in concert with different innovation frameworks using sets of indicators that may show varying degrees of correlation in order to drive the strategy of innovation systems as a dynamic group decision-theoretic process. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Group decision-making; Indicator analysis; Innovation systems; Multicriteria analysis","Indicator indicator; Decision making; Embedded systems; Group theory; Multi agent systems; Conventional approach; Decision theoretic approach; Innovation performance; Innovation system; Mahalanobis metric; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Multiple agents; Resources based; correlation; decision analysis; decision making; innovation; multicriteria analysis; performance assessment; planning method; preference behavior; strategic approach; Decision theory","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112281983"

The challenge of how to evaluate the impact coming from social innovation (SI) has emerged as an important question posed by various actors, such as academic researchers, students, project managers, leaders of organizations, and policymakers. To find an answer to this question, this research seeks to contribute to bridging the gap between SI initiatives and the evaluation of their impacts. Despite the interest and popularity of the topic of SI, this gap can be justified due to the lack of tools and frameworks to help organizations approach SI impact assessment. Although indicators have been widely used by researchers in different fields of study, the current literature has failed to develop indicators, frameworks or methodologies to assess the impact of SI initiatives. The research includes an investigation of the state of the art in terms of measuring the impact of SI, based on both scientific literature and practitioners' reports. Based on this analysis, a set of thirty-eight indicators was identified to assess the impact of SI. From the literature consulted, it can be seen that the results highlight the gap in the literature regarding the lack of instruments and frameworks. Regarding the set of thirty-eight indicators identified, if applied as a complement to a measurement tool, the indicators can be used as a first attempt to help organizations address the evaluation and effectiveness of the SI impact on their actions. The proposal may contribute to bring to light new evidence in the SI domain for policymakers, researchers and governments, then contributing to a better understanding of the impact of SI. © 2022, Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

This article argues that policing and public health are natural conceptual partners in that both seek to reduce morbidity and mortality with broad interventions at the community level. That said, to overcome the problems that lead to recurring crises in policing-things which the medical profession would refer to as the iatrogenic harms of policing's interventions-policing would be well-served to adopt many of the concepts and metrics of public health. One way to start this process would be to create an international center for policing and public health, which would combine research and practice in an iterative way that brings the two sectors into closer collaboration. The process could start with a series of executive sessions. Such an evolution would allow the civic leaders responsible for a community's policing and public safety to demonstrate increased accountability by aligning measures of their success with evidence-informed endpoints that show how policing has decreased a community's morbidity and mortality in meaningful ways, with minimized iatrogenic effects. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

However, only a small number of universities worldwide are collecting and publishing their carbon footprints, and some of them have defined zero emission targets. Unfortunately, there is limited consistency between the reported carbon footprints (CFs) because of different analysis methods, different impact measures, and different target definitions by the respective universities. Results: Comprehensive CF data of 20 universities from around the globe were collected and analysed. Essential factors contributing to the university CF were identified. For the first time, CF data from universities were not only compared. The CF data were also evaluated, partly corrected, and augmented by missing contributions, to improve the consistency and comparability. The CF performance of each university in the respective year is thus homogenized, and measured by means of two metrics: CO2e emissions per capita and per m2 of constructed area. Both metrics vary by one order of magnitude across the different universities in this study. However, we identified ten universities reaching a per capita carbon footprint of lower than or close to 1.0 Mt (metric tons) CO2e/person and year (normalized by the number of people associated with the university), independent from the university’s size. In addition to the aforementioned two metrics, we suggested a new metric expressing the economic efficiency in terms of the CF per $ expenditures and year. We next aggregated the results for all three impact measures, arriving at an overall carbon performance for the respective universities, which we found to be independent of geographical latitude. Instead the per capita measure correlates with the national per capita CFs, and it reaches on average 23% of the national impacts per capita. The three top performing universities are located in Switzerland, Chile, and Germany. Conclusion: The usual reporting of CO2 emissions is categorized into Scopes 1–3 following the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting Standard which makes comparison across universities challenging. In this study, we attempted to standardize the CF metrics, allowing us to objectively compare the CF at several universities. From this study, we observed that, almost 30 years after the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro (1992), the results are still limited. Only one zero emission university was identified, and hence, the transformation should speed up globally. © 2021, The Author(s).","Carbon footprinting; Carbon offsetting; Energy impacts; GHG accounting and reporting; Greenhouse gas emissions; Higher education institutions; Mobility impacts; Per capita carbon footprint; University carbon footprint; University sustainability; Zero emission university","Brazil; Chile; Germany; Rio de Janeiro [Brazil]; Switzerland; carbon footprint; innovation; science and technology; United Nations Conference on Environment and Development","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102353252"

In particular, digital models enable virtual simulations to predict product and process performances, as well as to generate digital contents to improve the general workflow. Digital models can also contain additional contents (e.g., model-based design (MBD)) to provide online and on-time information about process operations and management, as well as to support operator activities. The recent developments in augmented reality (AR) offer new specific interfaces to promote the great diffusion of digital contents into industrial processes, thanks to flexible and robust applications, as well as cost-effective devices. However, the impact of AR applications on sustainability is still poorly explored in research. In this direction, this paper proposed an innovative approach to exploit MBD and introduce AR interfaces in the industry to support human intensive processes. Indeed, in those processes, the human contribution is still crucial to guaranteeing the expected product quality (e.g., quality inspection). The paper also analyzed how this new concept can benefit sustainability and define a set of metrics to assess the positive impact on sustainability, focusing on social aspects. © 2021 by the authors.

The entrepreneurship patterns analysis was carried out using a customized artificial neural network considering as inputs the self-assessment of multiple intelligences from an interdisciplinary perspective. Thus, many important findings reveal that not all multiple intelligences have a direct and proportional impact on entrepreneurship intention. In fact, Linguistic–Verbal Intelligence, Intrapersonal Intelligence, and Interpersonal intelligence are the types of intelligence that have the greatest influence on entrepreneurial intentions. In addition, the performance metrics of the ANN for classifying the entrepreneurship intentions are higher than the ones reported in the literature (i.e., accuracy ≈ 99.29%, precision ≈ 98.89%, sensitivity ≈ 99.53%, and specificity ≈ 99.01%). The paper contributes to the literature on the deep understanding of entrepreneurs’ behavior concerning the strengths and weaknesses of their multiple intelligences. Besides, this interdisciplinary empirical work contributes to improving the design of methods and techniques to strengthen entrepreneurship from the earliest stages of students’ lives and promote sustainable businesses. The most surprising finding was the minimal relationship of Naturalistic Intelligence to undertake sustainable and robust projects, which demands more detailed and in-depth analysis. Finally, some proposals are presented to improve the teaching process of entrepreneurship and sustainability, considering the artificiality, sustainability, and entrepreneurship involved in academic programs at universities. © 2022 by the authors.

For this, first, we conducted a bibliometric analysis to evaluate the relationships between business model innovation and SBMI literature. After this, we performed a systematic literature review to create a comprehensive framework for managing SBMI. The biblio-metric analysis showed that the SBMI stream grew quickly and significantly in recent years, evolving into a separated new research stream, which does not leverage recent business model innovation advancements. Through the performed analyses, we were able to discuss critical gaps in the SBMI literature and shed light on possible pathways to solve these gaps through lessons learned from business model innovation. We depicted five critical gaps for managing SBMI; (1) the need to understand the sustainable business model as a wicked problem, in which SBMI leads to “better than before” solutions calling for systematic SBMI, (2) the poor definition of distinctive dimensions of dynamic capabilities for SBMI, (3) the lack of studies exploring the role of open innovation for improving the SBMI process, (4) the lack of tools supporting SBMI implementation and (5) the need to explore game-changing, competitive advantages of SBMI. The findings of this study contribute to guiding future research on SBMI, which can be a basis for further efforts towards sustainable development. © 2022 by the authors.

We also consider the moderating effect of political connections on the relationship between political uncertainty and firms' innovation. We use two different metrics of innovation: R&D (an input measure), and patent counts (an output measure). We find that firms with former politicians on their board of directors invest less in R&D than their counterpart firms. However, the presence of this type of director on the board is positively associated with the number of a firm's patent applications. It seems that, although political ties reduce the amount of resources devoted to R&D activities, they increase the effectiveness of intellectual rights protection. Results also show that political uncertainty decreases R&D investment but exacerbates the need for legal protection of innovation through patents.

This study seeks to inform scholars and public-sector managers about organizational design for innovation and technology acceleration using a systems approach. It examines three organizations responsible for mission-oriented innovation: In-Q-Tel, stood by up the Central Intelligence Agency; the FBI's Operational Technology Unit; and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). It finds that collaboration and mission-inspiration can bridge public–private sector divides, but that distance from operators can slow technology adoption. It recommends establishing metrics for innovation investments and outcomes and gaining a better understanding of end user needs. Venture capital characteristics in quasi-government innovation organizations show promise but are untested outside of defense and intelligence. This study contributes to the literature by analyzing technology acceleration rather than initiation, development, adoption, or diffusion.

Multi-criteria methods emerged to consider different factors in benchmarking assessment. However, there is a lack in considering occupants’ thermal satisfaction in methods based on actual data. The objective of this article is to propose a method to integrate thermal satisfaction into energy benchmarking. The main innovation is to propose a probabilistic metric that takes into account energy consumption, construction aspects, climate conditions, systems and thermal satisfaction level to benchmark a building. The method consists of a statistical analysis to select relevant variables in the building stock, the process of discretisation of such variables, and the developing and validation of a Bayesian Network to serve as an instrument for the benchmarking method. A detailed evidence-based dataset of 426 schools in Brazil was used. Results showed that buildings with low thermal satisfaction of occupants were benchmarked as less efficient than those with high thermal satisfaction and similar energy consumption. Regarding the validation step, the benchmarking model achieved an error rate ranging from 17.78% to 29.17%. The main conclusion is that machine learning techniques can adequately integrate subjective aspects such as occupant satisfaction in data-driven energy benchmarking methods. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Building energy performance; Building performance analysis; Energy benchmarking; Energy efficiency; School buildings","Brazil; Bayesian networks; Benchmarking; Buildings; Energy efficiency; Learning systems; Benchmarking methods; Building energy performance; Building evaluations; Building performance analysis; Data-driven approach; Energy benchmarking; Energy-consumption; Evidence-based; Operational performance; Thermal; basement (building); Bayesian analysis; benchmarking; building; innovation; integrated approach; learning; machine learning; spatiotemporal analysis; statistical analysis; Energy utilization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123077599"

Voluntary standards are instruments that can be used in GPP to drive innovation toward sustainability goals. However, there exists a lack of understanding of how to theoretically situate and practically execute GPP and voluntary standards within missions-oriented innovation systems (MIS). To address this research gap, this paper investigates how voluntary standards can be used to help formulate and achieve missions for sustainable urban development (SUD) at the municipal level, followed by what role green public procurement can play in this process. To do so, it establishes a first theoretical synthesis of GPP and MIS. Next, focusing on the Municipality of Amsterdam, it conducts an empirical investigation of 95 SUD projects, of which 55 were public tender projects (in which the municipality is the landowner) and 40 were non-public tender projects (in which a private entity is the landowner), supplemented by stakeholder interviews. Based on this, it (1) conceptualizes six sustainability ambitions as missions and examines each for their formulation in terms of targets and associated standards (problem-solution diagnosis), and (2) it maps the various actors engaged in the process of implementing these missions through SUD projects, defining their positions and interrelations within the MIS at the municipal level (structural analysis). Conclusions and reflections are made regarding the relationship between changing standards and regulations over time, the potential for GPP to increase progress toward missions via use of voluntary standards in public tenders. Until programmatic approaches to measuring progress toward missions are fully implemented, the presence of voluntary standards is suggested as a potential metric. © 2022 by the author.","ecolabels; emissions; environmental; green; green public procurement; implementation; mission-orientated innovation systems; sustainable public procurement; voluntary standards","Amsterdam [North Holland]; ecolabeling; implementation process; innovation; sustainability; urban development","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137179360"

However, despite the proliferation of evaluation metrics and procedures, there is a need to go beyond bibliometric approaches and to identify, more explicitly, what constitutes good research and which are its driving factors or determinants. This article reviews specialized research policy, science policy and scientometrics literature to extract critical dimensions associated with research quality as presented in a vast although fragmented theory background. A literature-derived framework of research quality attributes is, thus, obtained, which is subject to an expert feedback process, involving scholars and practitioners in the fields of research policy and evaluation. The results are represented by a structured taxonomy of 66 quality attributes providing a systemic definition of research quality. The attributes are aggregated into a three-dimensional framework encompassing research design (ex ante), research process (in-process) and research impact (ex post) perspectives. The main value of the study is to propose a literature-derived and comprehensive inventory of quality attributes and perspectives of evaluation. The findings can support further theoretical developments and research policy discussions on the ultimate drivers of quality and impact of scientific research. The framework can be also useful to design new exercises or procedures of research evaluation based on a multidimensional view of quality. © 2022 by the authors.

The anthropogenic input of greenhouse gases increases the atmospheric mean temperature. It furthermore leads to a higher probability of extreme weather events (e.g., heat waves, floods) and thus strongly impacts the habitats of humans, animals, and plants. Against this background, research and innovation activities are increasingly focusing on potential health-related aspects and feasible adaptation and mitigation strategies. Progressing urbanization and demographic change paired with the climate change-induced heat island effect exposes humans living in urban habitats to increasing health risks. By employing scientometric methods, this scoping study provides a systematic bird’s eye view on the epistemic landscapes of climate change, its health-related effects, and possible technological and nature-based interventions and strategies in order to make urban areas climate proof. Based on a literature corpus consisting of 2614 research articles collected in SCOPUS, we applied network-based analysis and visualization techniques to map the different scientific communities, discourses and their interrelations. From a public health perspective, the results demonstrate the range of either direct or indirect health effects of climate change. Furthermore, the results indicate that a public health-related scientific discourse is converging with an urban planning and building science driven discourse oriented towards urban blue and green infrastructure. We conclude that this development might mirror the socio-political demand to tackle emerging climate change-induced challenges by transgressing disciplinary boundaries. © 2022 by the authors.

Given that relatively little is known about the network structures that support Arctic innovation processes, we employ social network analysis techniques to examine the structural organization and evolution of ArcticNet, a large Canadian Arctic scientific research network over a 13-year period (2004 – 17). ArcticNet funded 152 multidisciplinary research teams, connecting multiple types of science-based innovation actors, not including students (301 organizations and 1659 individuals). The research network grew without reaching saturation (increasing size, decreasing density), suggesting that ArcticNet was successful in recruiting new actors over the 13-year period. ArcticNet was centralized around non-local, public-sector actors (mainly Canadian academics). The emergence of collaborations across several boundaries (sectoral, geographic, thematic) suggests that non-local Canadian academic actors played an important boundary-spanning role, particularly in the early stages of the network. Participation by local northern actors doubled from Phase 1 to Phase 4, and with time, local northern actors had an increasing propensity for carrying out boundary-spanning roles and addressing structural holes.

Presently, benchmarking strategies for WDNs are not fully developed, especially for analyzing intermittent systems commonly encountered in non-developed nations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an index-based benchmarking strategy for WDNs, comparing their actual hydraulic performance and expected serviceability. A robust Hydraulic Performance Index (HPI) is developed as a global metric to account for the combined impact of multiple hydraulic outputs, concerning their benchmark values. The applicability of this index is verified on a numerical benchmark network, and its usefulness is demonstrated on a real-world intermittent WDN located in Kolkata (India) by coupling the HPI-based framework with hydraulic models using the EPANET-MATLAB programmer's toolkit. A scenario-based analysis is conducted using extended-period simulation to obtain the HPI for diverse service levels and leakage conditions of the WDN models. The HPI is designed to effectively capture the localized pressure reduction during peak flow, prioritize hydraulic outputs based on regional constraints, and penalize systems with unsustainably high hydraulic output. The developed strategy is also effective in performance benchmarking of WDNs of different nations with diverse serviceability and threshold parameters on a common platform. Finally, the practical efficacy and generalizability of the HPI-based results in the context of case-specific performance management of WDNs, along with limitations, recommendations and future perspectives are elucidated upon. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","EPANET; Hydraulic benchmarking; Hydraulic performance index; Intermittent supply; Multi-criteria decision modeling; Performance management","Benchmarking; Computer Simulation; India; Water; Water Supply; India; Kolkata; West Bengal; water; benchmarking; composite; hydraulic phenomena; innovation; performance assessment; water management; article; benchmarking; data analysis software; drug efficacy; simulation; water supply; benchmarking; computer simulation; India","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113629533"

More importantly, the authors are concerned with whether a change of policy regime or a variance in the quality of technology will moderate the nature of innovation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors examined a dataset of 3.6 million Chinese patents during 1985–2015 and constructed more than 5 million citation pairs across 8 sections and 128 classes to track knowledge spillover across technology fields. The authors used this citation dataset to calculate the technology innovation network. The authors constructed a measure of upstream invention, interacting the pre-existing technology innovation network with historical patent growth in each technology field, and estimated measure's impact on future innovation since 2005. The authors also constructed three sets of metrics – technology dependence, centrality and scientific value – to identify innovation quality and a policy dummy to consider the impact of policy on innovation. Findings: Innovation growth is built upon past year accumulation and technology spillover. Innovation grows faster for technologies that are more central and grows more slowly for more valuable technologies. A pro-innovation and pro-intellectual property right (IPR) policy plays a positive and significant role in driving technical progress. The authors also found that for technologies that have faster access to new information or larger power to control knowledge flow, the upstream and downstream innovation linkage is stronger. However, this linkage is weaker for technologies that are more novel or general. On most occasions, the nature of innovation was less responsive to policy shock. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the debate on the nature of innovation by determining whether upstream innovation has strong predictive power on future innovation. The authors develop the assumption used in the technology spillover literature by considering a time-variant, directional and asymmetric matrix to model technology diffusion. For the first time, the authors answer how the nature of innovation will vary depending on the technology network configurations and policy environment. In addition to contributing to the academic debate, the authors' study has important implications for economic growth and industrial or innovation management policies. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Innovation; Network analysis; Patent citation; Upstream innovation","","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144065235"

However, knowledge gaps regarding training, acceptance, and practice preclude standardization and make it difficult to design algorithmic guidelines to optimize individualized management in the era of precision medicine. Summary: The harmony between patient expectations and oncologic goals creates the state of the art of OBCS. Nevertheless, to achieve these goals, multidisciplinary approach is a must. Surgical decisions require a comprehensive evaluation including patient factors, tumor biology, genetics, technical considerations, and adjunct therapies. Moreover, the quality-of-life (QOL) issues should be considered as the highest level of priority with a shared decision making instituted on realistic discussions with the patient. Key messages: The standardization in OBCS should be initiated via defining a breast surgeon who should gain theorical and practical competence on techniques via national or international educational programs. The algorithmic patient assessment with appropriate documentation before and after surgery should be established. A simple and safe global lexicon should be designed regarding techniques to be proposed and quality metrics to be considered. Additionally, international multicenter prospective trials should be instituted to overcome knowledge gaps. It is evident that OBCS is the perfect union of science with art. Nevertheless, at the very end, the question is not the nature of the surgeon/artist who would be the extremist, the innovator, or the conservative, but the patient's satisfaction, prognosis, and QOL that conclude the cascade of state of the art of OBCS.  © 2021 ","Complication; Cosmesis; Innovation; Oncoplastic surgery; Outcome; Quality of life","algorithm; breast calcification; breast cancer; breast ptosis; breast reduction; breast-conserving surgery; cancer radiotherapy; clinical practice; disease free survival; distant disease free survival; esthetic surgery; female; human; local recurrence free survival; multidisciplinary team; neoadjuvant therapy; oncoplastic breast conserving surgery; oncoplasty; outcome assessment; overall survival; partial mastectomy; patient assessment; patient satisfaction; quality of life; radical mastectomy; Review; simple mastectomy; surgeon; training; tumor volume","Review","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116139260"

We map these developments across themes derived from conceptual A&N pathways and expert consultations. We created an interactive Evidence and Gap Map (EGM) from a systematic search of published and gray literature since 2008, following Campbell Collaboration guidelines. We retrieved over 30,000 reports from published literature databases, and individually searched 20 online repositories. We systematically screened 24,359 reports by title and/or abstract, 1577 by full report, and included 904 eligible reports. The EGM consists of rows of thematic domains and columns of types of tools, metrics, and methods, as well as extensive coding applied as filters. Each cell of the map represents research surrounding a type of tool, metric, or method within a given theme. Reports in each cell are grouped by stage of development, which expand to a corresponding bibliography. Users can filter EGM reports by various characteristics. The 4 most populated domains were: diets, nutrition, and health; primary food production; water, sanitation, and hygiene; and environment and sustainability. The 4 most common types of metrics, methods, and tools were: diet metrics; footprint analysis (especially water); technology applications; and network or Bayesian analysis. Gaps represent areas of few or no reports of innovation between 2008 and 2018. There were gaps in reports and innovations related to: power or conflicts of interest; food environments; markets; private sector engagement; food loss and waste; conflict; study design and system-level tools, metrics, and methods. The EGM is a comprehensive tool to navigate advances in measurement in A&N research: to highlight trends and gaps, conduct further synthesis and development, and prioritize the agenda for future work.

This paper proposes that such innovations in accountancy are not merely technical but are driven by contextual economic imperatives. It shows how PM articulates with capital owner demand for maximal value creation under the shareholder value model of the corporation rationalized through neoliberal economic thought and new economy discourses. Performance metrics cascade through organizational levels so as to highlight the apparent contributions of actors held accountable for aspects of value creation. They allow a subtle shift away from Taylorist operational statistics based on demonstrated achievable values towards prospective calculative rationality that enjoins all to manage their own capacity to increase value amid expectations of continuous improvement. Quantifying labour by putative performance outputs also allows for differential levels of reward and the marketization of wage relations favoured by agency theory. It has been central to new ways of eliciting more output for less reward from gig economy and neotaylorist workers, while also enabling the emergence of the equity-owning ‘superstar manager class’ that Piketty sees as distinctive of contemporary inequality. Its members largely configure and benefit from performance-related pay frameworks that reward executives for minimizing costs relative to ‘maximizing’ of the value chains they oversee. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","gig economy; indicators; inequality; labour; metrics; neoliberalism; Performance measurement; valuation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083661493"

Our objective is to discuss the modelling gaps and opportunities to advance the science for multisector adaptation and tradeoffs. We focus on power system operational models, which typically represent key physical and economic aspects of grid operations over days to a year and assume a fixed power grid infrastructure. Due to computational burden, models are typically customized to reflect regional resource opportunities, data availability, and applications of interest. We conceptualize power system operational models with four core processes: physical grid assets (generation, transmission, loads, and storage), model objectives and purpose, institutions and decision agents, and performance metrics. We taxonomize the representations of these core processes based on a review of 23 existing models. Using science questions around grid and short term uncertainties, long term global change, and multisectoral technological innovation as examples, we report on tradeoffs in process fidelity and tractability that have been adopted by the research community to represent multisectoral interactions in power system operational models. Our recommendations for research directions are model-agnostic, focusing on core processes, their interactions with other human systems, and consider computational tradeoffs. © 2021 The Authors","Multisector dynamics; Power system operational models; Power systems; Review; Taxonomy","Digital storage; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Dynamic researches; Human-systems; Model gaps; Multisector dynamic; Operational modeling; Power; Power system; Power system operational model; Process representation; innovation; numerical model; power generation; smart grid; Commerce","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119048239"

In examining the social life of data artifacts, scholars draw from actor-network theory to emphasize data's ability to represent social reality while circulating within it, while others suggest formal data models fail to account for invisible relations on the ground. Yet little work has examined the role of human reflexivity in crafting complex human-data configurations in practice, such as how situated human actors relate to data representations within the social reality they intimately know themselves. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and data analytics integration from inside the digital safety-net, this article shows how health care workers recognize data simultaneously capture, obscure, and envision their everyday work of caring for the marginalized. By demonstrating how the same data point may in one context demonstrate good care while in another obscure it, these findings suggest need to broaden attention to the social life of data beyond delimited focus on standards and their travels.

The energy field is fast evolving, and the regulatory authorities have the difficult task of employing tariff methodologies which tackle the problems and challenges arising within it over the course of time. This paper analyses the regulation of power distribution and measurement in Italy as a case study of how regulation evolves as changes emerge. The customary tariff methodology, based on price-cap regulation to operating costs and rate of return on investments, has been coupled with output-based regulation, with the aim of a higher service quality, and input-based incentives to foster specific investments. Output based regulation has been gradually introduced because traditional price-cap regulation resulted in operators striving to attain efficiency and cost reduction at the expense of service quality. Nowadays, decarbonization and energy transition objectives call for the regulatory authority to develop a new tariff paradigm aimed at spurring innovation and introducing incentives based on total expenditures, where revenues are clearly linked to outputs and performance metrics. © 2021 Societa Editrice il Mulino.

These collaborations, which we have termed hybrid surgical offerings (HSOs) are often required for disease processes requiring interventions that fall outside the customary practice of children's surgeons. Formal models to describe or evaluate these practices are lacking. Methods: HSOs within a CH/LH were identified. Principles of systems-engineering were used to develop a standardized model (Children's Hybrid Enhanced Surgical Services [CHESS]) to describe and evaluate HSOs. Face validity was established via unstructured interviews of CH leaders and HSO surgeons. Areas for improved system-wide standardization and programmatic development were identified. Results: HSOs were identified in collaboration with adult bariatric, minimally invasive, advanced endoscopic, endocrine, thoracic, and orthopedic trauma surgical services. The CHESS framework encompassed: 1) quality improvement metrics, 2) credentialing and oversight, 3) transitions of care, 4) pediatric family-centered care, 5) maintenance of the cycle of expertise, 6) continuing medical education, 7) scholarship. While HSOs fulfilled the majority of aforementioned programmatic domains across all six HSO-providing services, areas for improvement included maintaining a cycle of expertise (33%), quality improvement metrics (50%), and pediatric family-centered care (66%). Additional noted advantages included faster translation of adult innovation to pediatric care and facilitation of emergency interdisciplinary care. Conclusion: Formal evaluation of HSOs is necessary to standardize and improve the quality of children's surgical care. Development of a structured framework such as CHESS addresses gaps in quality oversight and provides a basis for performance improvement, patient safety, and programmatic development. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Credentialing; Innovation; Oversight; Quality; Safety; Transitions","Adult; Child; Hospitals, Pediatric; Humans; Quality Improvement; Specialties, Surgical; Surgeons; accreditation; adult; Article; bariatric surgery; child; cholecystectomy; continuing education; education program; endocrine surgery; endoscopic surgery; family centered care; follow up; human; minimally invasive surgery; neonatal intensive care unit; normal human; orthopedic surgery; patient care; pediatric surgeon; pediatric surgery; standardization; thorax surgery; total quality management; transition to adult care; unstructured interview; hospital; surgeon; surgery","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114673628"

Previous research suggests that insufficient validation, complexity of interpretation, and lack of standardization are salient obstacles to adoption. In this paper we aim to better understand the policy challenges associated with adopting NAMs in chemical risk assessment; and to identify actions that could facilitate and accelerate their formal adoption internationally. We conducted a Delphi study – a group communication process that solicits expert judgments through iterative questioning and feedback – with panelists from government, industry, and non-governmental organizations in Europe and North America. Expert panelists identified two key activities to facilitate and accelerate the validation of NAMs internationally: 1) the development of common data collection, reporting and sharing procedures; and 2) the improvement of knowledge about new test methods among members of the regulatory community. Both activities suggest the need for a common regulatory science infrastructure, including international regulatory dialogues, large-scale research collaborations, and coordinated innovation in technological tools, the discourse of scientific validation, and regulatory procedures. To build trust across many sites (laboratories, regulatory agencies, contract research organizations, chemical producers, and the public), stakeholders will need to agree on validation requirements for particular uses (content in relation to context) as well as how results are to be communicated (data format), and measured (metrics). There is also a need for a global orchestrator, who can exert leadership and inspire voluntary cooperation of diverse organizations to address shared validation goals, to play a key role. © 2021 The Author(s)","Ecotoxicology; Governance; Innovation; Pollution; Regulatory science; Risk Assessment and Management","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118758443"

Previous studies have confirmed that some urban functional areas produce pronounced local heat/cold island effects in cities; however, the mitigating of this effect from the perspective of surrounding landscapes has not been investigated in depth. Additionally, different types of industrial plants have not been individually studied across multiple cities as major contributors to the local heat island effect. Therefore, based on 17 mega plants in various cities in the Northern Hemisphere, this study explores the impact of surrounding landscapes on the surface industrial heat island (SIHI) effect, proposes cooling metrics from a new landscape patch perspective, and quantifies the impact of different patch configurations on the SIHI using Extreme Gradient Boosting regression models and Shapley Additive exPlanations. The primary results are as follows: 1) Regarding to the footprint of the SIHI effect, the coverage of impervious surfaces dominates the ambient LST pattern. Industrial plant types and latitudes are moderately influencing factors. 2) In terms of the cooling effect, landscape patch size and width relative to industrial plant size has a pronounced impact on the LST cooling speed. Besides, various land cover types have distinct relative cooling thresholds for patch area and distance from the plants. The influence of patch attributes on LST cooling speed is determined by the distinct land cover type. 3) What is prominent is that the patches of water bodies with larger relative footprints often exhibit higher cooling speeds. This study aims to provide guidelines for urban planners in assessing the local thermal environment and mitigating further urban warming. © 2022 The Author(s).

However, its adoption rate is still reported as low in the construction industry due to a lack of expertise and the limited reliable applications for AI technology. Hence, this paper aims to present the detailed outcome of experimentations evaluating the applicability and the performance of AI object detection algorithms for construction modular object detection. Design/methodology/approach: This paper provides a thorough evaluation of two deep learning algorithms for object detection, including the faster region-based convolutional neural network (faster RCNN) and single shot multi-box detector (SSD). Two types of metrics are also presented; first, the average recall and mean average precision by image pixels; second, the recall and precision by counting. To conduct the experiments using the selected algorithms, four infrastructure and building construction sites are chosen to collect the required data, including a total of 990 images of three different but common modular objects, including modular panels, safety barricades and site fences. Findings: The results of the comprehensive evaluation of the algorithms show that the performance of faster RCNN and SSD depends on the context that detection occurs. Indeed, surrounding objects and the backgrounds of the objects affect the level of accuracy obtained from the AI analysis and may particularly effect precision and recall. The analysis of loss lines shows that the loss lines for selected objects depend on both their geometry and the image background. The results on selected objects show that faster RCNN offers higher accuracy than SSD for detection of selected objects. Research limitations/implications: The results show that modular object detection is crucial in construction for the achievement of the required information for project quality and safety objectives. The detection process can significantly improve monitoring object installation progress in an accurate and machine-based manner avoiding human errors. The results of this paper are limited to three construction sites, but future investigations can cover more tasks or objects from different construction sites in a fully automated manner. Originality/value: This paper’s originality lies in offering new AI applications in modular construction, using a large first-hand data set collected from three construction sites. Furthermore, the paper presents the scientific evaluation results of implementing recent object detection algorithms across a set of extended metrics using the original training and validation data sets to improve the generalisability of the experimentation.

Instead, the author focuses explicitly on how organizational members, through their use of KPIs in innovation, make sense of conflicting interpretations and integrate them into their practices. A qualitative in-depth case study was conducted at the innovation department of an organization in the process industry that operates production sites and sales organizations worldwide. In total, 28 interviews and complementary observations were undertaken at several organizational levels (multi-level). The empirical evidence suggests that strategic change, attributed to commoditization, affects the predetermined KPIs in use. Notably, these KPIs in innovation are used, despite their poor fit to innovation subject to commoditization. From a relational perspective, this study indicates that in innovation, KPIs are usually complemented by or supplemented with other information, as stand-alone KPIs exhibit a significant degree of incompleteness. In contrast to conventional studies in innovation and management accounting, this study explores the use of key performance indicators (KPIs) in innovation from an interpretative perspective. This perspective advances our understanding of the actual use of KPIs and uncovers the complexity of accounting and innovation, which involve numerous angles and organizational levels. Practically, the findings of this study will inform managers in innovation about the use of KPIs in innovation and the challenges individual organizational members face when using them. In innovation, KPIs appear to be subjective and used in unintended ways. Thus, understanding how KPIs are used in innovation is a game of reading between the lines, and these KPIs can be regarded as misfits. © 2021 by the author.","business performance; case study; innovation; management accounting; metrics in use; performance measurement","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165780598"

Still, no studies have confirmed or denied that EVA is a universal metric and that one may use EVA in unstable markets in the same way as in stable and developed economies. Meanwhile, the green energy revolution, ensuring carbon neutrality through green innovations, requires enormous investments, and the projects realised must be appropriately tailored. These projects are realised by different firms, including those from developing countries, and investors need solid financial metrics. The study determines whether EVA is a universal metric of owners’ value in the energy sector. The research proves that this metric does not correctly reflect the limitations of emerging markets, can lead to incorrect managerial decisions and limit shareholders’ value. Therefore, there is a need to reanalyse financial metrics used in financial planning, including EVA. The study eliminates this research gap and, based on data from seven countries and the Euro Zone, explains why one may not perceive the currently used EVA formula as a universal financial metric. Consequently, the study modifies the EVA formula and presents a universal solution tailored to unstable economies. In the conducted research, literature studies were used, taking into account the methodology of a systematic literature review, including bibliometric analysis. Based on this review, it is shown that little is known about whether EVA as a financial measure can be used in energy management. Two conclusions emerged: first, the research contributes to developing the business and management science; second, identifying risks associated with EVA metrics helps practitioners. In addition, the study defined further research directions. © 2022 by the authors.

As with every innovation it is crucial to understand why companies and managers should implement them for their operation. Therefore, one must understand the underlying economic drivers that lead to the necessity to change the status quo. The fact that NDE 4.0, like Industry 4.0, is a collective term for technologies ranging from artificial intelligence (AI) over robotics to additive manufacturing (AM) leads to an unclear picture of the relevance for individual stakeholders. Certainly, not all technologies provide value in the same way for every company and situation. Therefore, it is important to explore the technologies combined into NDE 4.0 individually. It is crucial that responsible managers carefully analyze the impact of each aspect on their operation and business. Is there a risk for an external disruption? Is it possible to increase efficiency? Is a fundamental process transformation required? As NDE managers are operating in a commercial setting, it is required to formulate the impact in economic terms. Of course, technical evaluation is also very important, and every responsible person must first check the technical viability and whether an innovation can be certified against industry standards. But finally, the innovation must be assessed in terms of economic viability. This means there must be an assessment of the costs, savings, and ultimately return of investment (ROI). Otherwise, it is impossible to quantitatively justify the investment to the company’s management or controllers. This publication will provide commonly used tools to valuate an innovation and will also address important aspects that have to be taken into consideration. This chapter will focus on the introduction of economic value drivers, performance metrics, risk assessment, and different types of innovation. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.","Change management; Economics; Industry 4.0; Innovation; NDE 4.0; Transformation; Valuation","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158935394"

To improve and innovate the conduct of clinical trials, it is exploring the uses of gamification to better engage the trial workforce and improve the efficiencies of trial activities. The gamification structures described in this article are part of a TIN website gamification toolkit, available online to the clinical trial scientific community. Methods: The game designers used existing electronic trial platforms to gamify the tasks required to meet trial start-up timelines to create friendly competitions. Key indicators and familiar metrics were mapped to scoreboards. Webinars were organized to share and applaud trial and game performance. Results: Game scores were significantly associated with an increase in achieving start-up milestones in activation, institutional review board (IRB) submission, and IRB approval times, indicating the probability of completing site activation faster by using games. Overall game enjoyment and feelings that the game did not apply too much pressure appeared to be an important moderator of performance in one trial but had little effect on performance in a second. Conclusion: This retrospective examination of available data from gaming experiences may be a first-of-kind use in clinical trials. There are signals that gaming may accelerate performance and increase enjoyment during the start-up phase of a trial. Isolating the effect of gamification on trial outcomes will depend on a larger sampling from future trials, using well-defined, hypothesis-driven statistical analysis plans. © The Author(s), 2022.","clinical trials; Gamification; metrics; Trial Innovation Network; trial start-up","Article; clinical trial (topic); controlled study; gamification; institutional review; webinar; workforce","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131129576"

The underlying idea is that growth, development, technological change, income inequality, spatial disparities, and resilience are the visible outcomes of hidden systemic interactions. The study of economic complexity seeks to understand the structure of these interactions and how they shape various socioeconomic processes. This emerging field relies heavily on big data and machine learning techniques. This brief introduction to economic complexity has three aims. The first is to summarize key theoretical foundations and principles of economic complexity. The second is to briefly review the tools and metrics developed in the economic complexity literature that exploit information encoded in the structure of the economy to find new empirical patterns. The final aim is to highlight the insights from economic complexity to improve prediction and political decision-making. Institutions including the World Bank, the European Commission, the World Economic Forum, the OECD, and a range of national and regional organizations have begun to embrace the principles of economic complexity and its analytical framework. We discuss policy implications of this field, in particular the usefulness of building recommendation systems for major public investment decisions in a complex world. © 2021","Complex systems; Economic complexity; Geography; Innovation; Policy","Decision making; Economics; Investments; Learning systems; Economic complexity; Geography; Income inequality; Innovation; Issues and challenges; Machine learning techniques; Societal issues; Socioeconomic process; Technological change; Theoretical foundations; Public policy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121468830"

(2019), we used simulations to quantitatively compare the bias of commonly used study designs in ecology and conservation. Based on these simulations, we proposed ‘accuracy weights’ as a potential way to account for study design validity in meta-analytic weighting methods. Pescott and Stewart (2022) raised concerns that these weights may not be generalisable and still lead to biased meta-estimates. Here we respond to their concerns and demonstrate why developing alternative weighting methods is key to the future of evidence synthesis. We acknowledge that our simple simulation unfairly penalised randomised controlled trial (RCT) relative to before-after control-impact (BACI) designs as we considered that the parallel trends assumption held for BACI designs. We point to an empirical follow-up study in which we more fairly quantify differences in biases between different study designs. However, we stand by our main findings that before-after (BA), control-impact (CI) and after designs are quantifiably more biased than BACI and RCT designs. We also emphasise that our ‘accuracy weighting’ method was preliminary and welcome future research to incorporate more dimensions of study quality. We further show that over a decade of advances in quality effect modelling, which Pescott and Stewart (2022) omit, highlights the importance of research such as ours in better understanding how to quantitatively integrate data on study quality directly into meta-analyses. We further argue that the traditional methods advocated for by Pescott and Stewart (2022; e.g. manual risk-of-bias assessments and inverse-variance weighting) are subjective, wasteful and potentially biased themselves. They also lack scalability for use in large syntheses that keep up-to-date with the rapidly growing scientific literature. Synthesis and applications. We suggest, contrary to Pescott and Stewart's narrative, that moving towards alternative weighting methods is key to future-proofing evidence synthesis through greater automation, flexibility and updating to respond to decision-makers' needs—particularly in crisis disciplines in conservation science where problematic biases and variability exist in study designs, contexts and metrics used. While we must be cautious to avoid misinforming decision-makers, this should not stop us investigating alternative weighting methods that integrate study quality data directly into meta-analyses. To reliably and pragmatically inform decision-makers with science, we need efficient, scalable, readily automated and feasible methods to appraise and weight studies to produce large-scale living syntheses of the future. © 2022 British Ecological Society.","automation; bias adjustment; critical appraisal; dynamic meta-analyses; evidence synthesis; living reviews; quality effects modelling; risk of bias","conservation status; ecological modeling; empirical analysis; innovation; simulation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127190250"

In this study, an innovative modeling approach is formulated as resilience-oriented multi-objective two-stage scenario-based stochastic modeling based on mixed-integer-linear-programming.

Some authors even posit that efficient collaboration is more important to organizational innovation and performance than individual skills or expertise. However, the lack of efficient models to manage collaboration properly is a major constraint for organizations to profit from internal and external collaborative initiatives. Currently, much of the collaboration in organizations occurs through virtual network channels, such as e-mail, Yammer, Jabber, Microsoft Teams, Skype, and Zoom. These are even more important in situations where different time zones and even threats of a pandemic constrain face-to-face human interactions. This work introduces a multidisciplinary heuristic model developed based on project risk management and social network analysis centrality metrics graph-theory to quantitatively measure dynamic organizational collaboration in the project environment. A case study illustrates the proposed model's implementation and application in a real virtual project organizational context. The major benefit of applying this proposed model is that it enables organizations to quantitatively measure different collaborative, organizational, and dynamic behavioral patterns, which can later correlate with organizational outcomes. The model analyzes three collaborative project dimensions: network collaboration cohesion evolution, network collaboration degree evolution, and network team set variability evolution. This provides organizations an innovative approach to understand and manage possible collaborative project risks that may emerge as projects are delivered. Organizations can use the proposed model to identify projects' critical success factors by comparing successful and unsuccessful delivered projects' dynamic behaviors if a substantial number of both project types are analyzed. The proposed model also enables organizations to make decisions with more information regarding the support for changes in observed collaborative patterns as demonstrated by statistical models in general, and linear regressions in particular. Further, the proposed model provides organizations with a completely bias-free data-collection process that eliminates organizational downtime. Finally, applying the proposed model in organizations will reduce or eliminate the risks associated with virtual collaborative dynamics, leading to the optimized use of resources; this will transform organizations to become more lean-oriented and significantly contribute to economic, social, and environmental global sustainability. © 2021 China Ordnance Society","Innovation; Project critical success factor; Project outcome; Project performance; Project risk management; Social network analysis; Sustainability","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109457752"

Finally, the models were compared to Target and Taylor diagram. Findings: Meta-ensemble models have been developed for labor productivity prediction by combining machine learning models. Voting ensemble by combining et, gbm, xgboost, lightgbm, catboost and mlp models and stacking ensemble by combining et, gbm, xgboost, catboost and mlp models were created and finally the Et model as meta-learner was selected. Considering the prediction success, it has been determined that the voting and stacking meta-ensemble algorithms have higher prediction success than other machine learning algorithms. Model evaluation metrics, namely MAE, MSE, RMSE and R2, were selected to measure the prediction success. For the voting meta-ensemble algorithm, the values of the model evaluation metrics MAE, MSE, RMSE and R2 are 0.0499, 0.0045, 0.0671 and 0.7886, respectively. For the stacking meta-ensemble algorithm, the values of the model evaluation metrics MAE, MSE, RMSE and R2 are 0.0469, 0.0043, 0.0658 and 0.7967, respectively. Research limitations/implications: The study shows the comparison between machine learning algorithms and created novel meta-ensemble machine learning algorithms to predict the labor productivity of construction formwork activity. The practitioners and project planners can use this model as reliable and accurate tool for predicting the labor productivity of construction formwork activity prior to construction planning. Originality/value: The study provides insight into the application of ensemble machine learning algorithms in predicting construction labor productivity. Additionally, novel meta-ensemble algorithms have been used and proposed. Therefore, it is hoped that predicting the labor productivity of construction formwork activity with high accuracy will make a great contribution to construction project management. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Construction; Estimating; Innovation; Management; Productivity; Technology","Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Productivity; Project management; Construction labours; Ensemble algorithms; Estimating; Innovation; Labour productivities; Machine learning algorithms; Machine learning models; Prediction modelling; Stackings; Technology; Forecasting","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142232450"

It is achieved by detecting data received from sensor nodes using IoT technology and processing it using a strategy for remote patient monitoring based on machine learning. This is as the data transmission is carried out by a sensor in the network, which utilises the power backup of the nodes. Even successful ways of data collection from several nodes in smart wearable patches and data aggregation may reduce the network’s power supply. Therefore, the heuristic algorithm opportunistic power optimum performance algorithm (OP2A) is employed to increase the sensor nodes’ lifetime in the healthcare system. This eliminates unnecessary data loops between network patches, and the algorithm’s effectiveness is measured in terms of network lifetime, latency in sensing data, throughput, and error metrics. In addition, the gateway manages the service and communicates with the data server using the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). Using self-trained models, the suggested machine learning approach predicts the health state. This gets rid of any unnecessary data loops between the network’s wearable patches, and the algorithm’s effectiveness is measured by the network’s lifespan, how long it takes to sense data, how much data it can handle, and how many errors it makes. © 2022, Scibulcom Ltd..

We consider data obtained from scientific publications and periodicals dedicated to the relatively new type of enterprise capital, managerial human capital. Modern scientific publications and periodicals do not represent operational definitions of these concepts and metrics for measuring these types of capital. All metrics offered by researchers are designed and suitable for top managers only and are not applied, e.g., for managers of innovation projects. We investigate the actual points of view concerning definitions and measurability of non-financial capital, in particular, the concept of managerial human capital, and propose to enlarge this concept from its use for not top managers only, but also for all employees of the company, who not only hold managerial position (permanently) but also carry out managerial roles (temporarily). We also propose the conceptual model and metrics for individual and corporate administrative, human capital using the competence approach. The proposed model and metrics are simply independent of financial indicators.

This paper seeks to test the existence of a “long-run” equilibrium (LRE) dynamic between trademarks and patents, as it would suggest that similar exogenous pressures concomitantly drive these metrics. The restraint in the divergence of the two indices supports an important aspect of the Innovation Agenda, a normative intellectual property (IP)-centric model of the firm, whereby the corporate strategy of science and technology firms is defined by constructing and communicating IP. Design/Methodology/Approach. Empirical analysis using descriptive statistics, wavelet, cointegration, and structural break analysis is applied to monthly US trademark and patent applications from 1977-2016 to test the potential for LRE. Results/Discussion. This work finds that the indices have similar (identical) structural attributes (including distribution characteristics, seasonal variation, and short-term cross-periodicity) and are cointegrated (I(1)). Further, structural breakpoints were (near) simultaneous (Trademarks: 1987, 1993, 1999, 2005, 2011; Patents: 1988, 1994, 2000, and 2011). A discussion of potential triggers causing these breaks and the concept of equilibrium in the context of these proxy measures is presented. Conclusions. From the study, likely, US trademark and patent applications are intimately linked; thus, increasing the likelihood that the Innovation Agenda may correctly capture at least one aspect of the firm. As a corollary, this work further supports the inclusion of trademark analysis in innovation studies. The limitations of the approach including study design are presented. Originality/Value. To the author’s knowledge, the existence of an LRE of trademarks and patents in the framework of the Innovation Agenda is a novel contribution. © 2021 Daizadeh.","cointegration; innovation; innovation agenda; patents; structural breakpoints; Trademarks","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108645686"

The metric is applied to a case study that compares eight different product-based utilities including four different furniture products, sold in two different business models. The case study confirms that the ME-metric rewards long lifespans and high-endurance features like repairability, upgradeability, and adaptability. The ME-metric also rewards business models that encourage customers to retain the same product over longer periods of time and utilities that deliver higher value to the end-customer. The metric can be used for cross-product and cross-sector comparisons and can thereby be a catalyst for circular innovation and transition. © 2021 The Authors","Circular business model; Circular economy; Endurance; Metric; Slowing loops; Value retention","Cost accounting; Business models; Case-studies; Circular business model; Circular economy; Economic values; Metric; Simple++; Slowing loop; Value data; Value retention; business; cost analysis; innovation; accounting; Article; circular economy; commercial phenomena; economic aspect; economic evaluation; life cycle assessment; market endurance; mathematical analysis; mathematical parameters; product market; Commerce","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121309115"

Operating in market conditions, most IT companies are forced to develop new innovative ideas and present them in the form of startups At the same time, small and medium-sized businesses interact with many external independent potential customers. Such users of information systems may subsequently become clients of such enterprises. The growth and development of these SaaS enterprises relies heavily on the average customer, which is the topic of this article, with the goal of reducing customer churn. The direction of such research is addressed in many of the rules of thumb for SaaS metrics. In these conditions, it is important to take into account the completeness of the functional interaction of SaaS customers, the authors proposed a hypothesis on the possibility of using intelligent methods for predicting customer churn using deep learning neural networks. At the same time, the needs of the stakeholders of such projects should be taken into account, the satisfaction of which occurs when interacting with an innovative IT product. To describe the interactions, the authors consider mathematical models, and also propose modeling methods. To conduct chain training, Python functionality is used, with the processing of user activity datasets.

This situation has driven government policy level support for transformational change initiatives, such as value-based health care (VBHC), through closer alignment and collaboration across the health-care system-life science sector nexus. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the necessary antecedents to collaboration in VBHC through a critical exploration of the existing literature, with a view to establishing the foundations for further development of policy, practice and theory in this field. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review was conducted via searches on Scopus and Google Scholar between 2009 and 2019 for peer-reviewed articles containing keywords and phrases “Value-based healthcare industry” and “healthcare industry collaboration”. Refinement of the results led to the identification of “guiding conditions” (GCs) for collaboration in VBHC. Findings: Five literature-derived GCs were identified as necessary for the successful implementation of initiatives such as VBHC through system-sector collaboration. These are: a multi-disciplinarity; use of appropriate technological infrastructure; capturing meaningful metrics; understanding the total cycle-of-care; and financial flexibility. This paper outlines research opportunities to empirically test the relevance of the five GCs with regard to improving system-sector collaboration on VBHC. Originality/value: This paper has developed a practical and constructive framework that has the potential to inform both policy and further theoretical development on collaboration in VBHC. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Government; Health care; Industry; Innovation; Life science sector; Management; NHS; Organization; Policy; Process; VBHC","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089155460"

Although data-driven innovation has been proved effective in creating value across many business functions, the pace of adoption of strong data ecosystems seems slower for Arts and Cultural Organizations (ACOs). The paper theoretically explores how data analytics can affect different areas of innovation in the core cultural sectors. By integrating marketing intelligence, arts management and policy literature with illustrative evidence from secondary sources, we discuss the potential impact of data analytics for enhancing ACOs innovation. First, digitalization and connectivity have increased opportunities for customer engagement and empowerment, shifting cultural consumption from a transaction to a relationship with cultural organizations. Second, data-driven metrics allow ACOs and policy makers to match more effectively patterns of consumption and eventually to create value from harvesting and processing information. Finally, although ACOs are encouraged to review their traditional business models through this new trajectory, significant conceptual and organizational barriers question the benefits of data analytics and slow down its adoption.

The Underwater Acoustic Sensor Network (UWASN) uses a 3D geographic zone for cooperative sampling to gather data and uses the crow search algorithm to distribute the data among the nodes.20 samples from each group were collected with a pre-test power of 80%, an error of 0.05, a confidence level of 95%, and 0.05 was chosen as the cutoff point for training the data sets. By changing the node distance, the proposed algorithm routing metrics are examined in a virtual underwater environment using the Aquasim patch and NS2 simulator. When compared to DBR's energy (1mJ) with delay, the proposed DEOCSA performs best for dynamically changing environmental and geographical topological conditions (850ms) The statistical research demonstrates that the least significant value (P0.05) for energy optimization is energy (\mathbf{P}=0.05). The simulation results show that by using the recommended Crow Search algorithm rather than Depth Based Routing Algorithm, the sensor network's energy efficiency is increased by shortening the time spent choosing the best nodes.  © 2022 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence; Crow Search Algorithm; Depth-based Routing; Energy Optimization; Green Energy; Innovation; UWASN","Acoustic devices; Energy efficiency; Internet protocols; Learning algorithms; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Underwater acoustics; Crow search algorithm; Depth-based routing; Distributed energies; Energy; Energy optimization; Green energy; Innovation; Routings; Search Algorithms; Underwater acoustic sensor networks; Routing algorithms","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147854356"

However, there is poor understanding of how smallholder farmers access beneficial outcomes from changes in agricultural practices, beyond narrow and simplistic metrics, such as adoption rates and yield increases. Furthermore, binary notions of adopters and non-adopters provides a poor basis for understanding innovation within complex farming systems. By integrating an innovation systems perspective with the theory of affordances, we explore how agricultural innovation happens in the context of two CSA interventions in the Tanga Region of Tanzania, to examine who has access to, and is able to benefit from interventions, who does not, and why. Drawing on ethnographic and interview data involving over 200 participants, we demonstrate how innovation processes in this context are diverse and non-linear, and discuss how potential outcomes derived from programmes are shaped by farmers’ affordances. We argue that common programme reporting metrics fail to account for the dynamic and nonlinearity of innovation processes and risk overlooking unintended outcomes of interventions. We propose that interventions should be conceived with an appreciation of context and affordances from the outset, to support how they engage with the least capable from the very beginning. © 2021","Affordances theory; Agricultural innovation systems; Agricultural research and development; Agriculture; Climate change; Smallholder","Tanga [Tanzania]; Tanzania; agricultural development; climate change; ethnography; innovation; research and development; smallholder","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115323014"

In this order, publications linking innovation to effectuation are presented and discussed through a methodology based on the publish and perish tool. In the last two decades, effectuation has become an active criterion in entrepreneurship research. However, previous studies do not in-terconnect effectuation to the different innovation approaches. In order to overcome this gap, this paper focuses on studying innovation in an effectual context and linking different innovation approaches to effectual logic. Indeed, effectuation is a way of thinking that serves entrepreneurs in the processes of opportunity identification and new venture creation. Effectuation includes a set of de-cision-making principles expert entrepreneurs are observed to employ in situations of uncertainty (as defined in Society for Effectual Action). This article outlines the four most-studied innovation approaches from the date of their apparitions until January 2021: frugal innovation, disruptive in-novation, lean start-up, and design thinking. In this context, effectuation as the essence of innovation must be clarified as a method that has similarities and differences with frugal and disruptive innovation, lean start-up, and design thinking. To validate the proposed theorical model, a biblio-metrics tool, named “Harzing publish” or “perish”, is used. The main finding of this research affirms that the two most linked innovation approaches to effectuation are “lean start-up” and “de-sign thinking”, compared to “frugal innovation” and “disruptive innovation”. In an entrepreneurial innovation context, design thinking and lean start-up are flexible tools that can stimulate and validate the effectual cycle. © 2021 by the authors.

Virtually everyone is now familiar with the term Sustainable Development, from states to multinational corporations, and from affluent communities in the Global North to impoverished communities in the Global South. It received a new lease of life in 2015 when the United Nations General Assembly adopted Agenda 2030 and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It is recognized that sustainable development requires an inter-disciplinary, multi-level, and bottom-up approach, and that this ideal is easy to state but difficult to operationalize. Pursuant to deliberations at an international workshop at the University of Wisconsin-Madison1, which aimed at fostering the exchange of ideas among diverse experts and developing solutions for effective inclusion of women and youth in climate change response strategies, we propose an innovative, practical three-dimensional model that enhances sustainability theory and practice with cross-cutting integration of human rights, gender equity, and Indigenous and local knowledge. We evaluate the utility of the model in two ways: First, we analyze how the model informs current approaches to environmental sustainability and human wellbeing including the SDGs, agroecology, de-growth principles, and planetary health metrics. Then, we explore the feasibility and added value of the approach through seven case studies from Guatemala, Sri Lanka, Malawi, Peru, Côte D’Ivoire, and Aotearoa – New Zealand. We conclude that the proposed model is congruent with current theory and practice. It builds on existing principles by identifying and addressing gaps. It enables practical action in a variety of settings and fosters a more integrated approach to sustainable wellbeing for humanity and our earth. We recommend continued development of this theoretical framework and related guidelines for program design, implementation and evaluation. © 2020 by the authors.

Historically, VOE values have dropped rapidly and will further, yet slower, decline in the future. Additionally, VOE values for residential and utility installations converge at different levels, indicating a stronger diversification of these market segments. Similarly, local differences in VOE suggest a regional market diversification. Advanced concepts like n-type monocrystalline PERC silicon solar cells could be economically preferable to multicrystalline silicon solar cells in some countries but may fare worse in others, including China and India. Extending the analysis to tandem photovoltaics, we confirm its potential to improve LCOEs for residential applications but foresee challenges for utility markets. Finally, we explore detrimental impacts of degradation and show that competing for lower LCOEs demands matching degradation rates of established technologies. What is the value of increasing the efficiency of a solar cell? In this paper, we introduce the value of efficiency (VOE), a metric that determines the maximum allowable cost for an innovation to improve the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). We then use this metric to analyze trends. Looking at historical data, we find that the VOE has declined rapidly in the past. Looking forward we still project a reduction but at a much-reduced pace. In addition, we observed that different markets converge at different values, indicating a technology diversification to better address different needs. One example is tandem solar cells, a high-efficiency photovoltaic (PV) concept that could help to provide electricity cheaper to homes in the future. We also observe a variation depending on location, indicating that different technologies could flourish regionally. Finally, we highlight the vital need for new PV technologies, like perovskites, to match leading technologies degradation rates. Here, we introduce the value of efficiency (VOE), a metric that determines the maximum allowable cost for an innovation to improve the levelized cost of electricity. We use this metric to analyze historic, regional, and technological trends. We find indications for a stronger regional and sectoral market diversification.

However, there is limited literature that acknowledges the scholarly output and impact of U.S.-Africa university research collaboration in support of their respective institutions’ comprehensive internationalization goals. Using Michigan State University (MSU)—a public, research-intensive, land grant university with long history of engagement with Africa, as a case study, this paper aims to measure the research output, describe the collaboration patterns and research trends, and assess the impact of MSU’s research engagement on Africa for the last 10 years (2006–2015). It also attempts to determine the gender dimension of MSU’s research focus on Africa. Our scientometric and social network analysis provide strong quantitative evidence of scholarly success, research focus and diversification, collaboration, and impact on MSU’s engagement on Africa, especially in science, technology, engineering, and math-related disciplines. The co-authorship data provides evidence of greater collaboration of MSU with non-African countries on African-focused research but a growing number of partner institutions from African countries. This growing collaboration provides significant benefits on strategic research conducted and its impact, as well as increasing the recognition of African researchers as contributors to impactful international research collaborations and improving the ability of MSU and its global and African partners to co-generate knowledge and innovation that can help solve global problems more effectively. Finally, this study provides additional evidence of the increasing involvement of women in advancing knowledge and global innovation to address Africa’s socio-economic development challenges.

We used questionnaires to examine changes in viewers’ perceived understanding, interest, and motivation after watching episodes at in-person screenings during September 2019 (average 27.5 attendees and 19.5 respondents per episode screening). In general, perception of skills and engagement increased after viewing the episode, and viewers reported a willingness to take action themselves as well as to pledge support for the use of public funds in water-related actions. However, viewers were less swayed on topics such as the “ickiness” of recycled water and on policies that allow black water recycling. At the final screening of the series, we also investigated preference for in-depth content versus a synoptic episode via structured focus groups. With a high degree of consensus, focus group participants felt that topics were better presented in episodes with more in-depth content. These results support the use of long-form, content-rich educational videos to teach water science and increase motivation. In combination with TV viewing metrics, our study thus supports the use of TV as an effective medium for reaching a broad demographic.

We argue that the value of knowledge content can be a function of both the amount and quality of resources available to its contributor. Drawing on literature grounded in Service-Dominant logic and Resource-Advantage theory, we suggest that resources controlled by users in online Q&A community can be classified into informational, skill-related and social resources. Utilizing both structured and unstructured behavioral data retrieved from 135,808 answers provided by 114,112 contributors to 300 hot questions on Zhihu in 2018, we extract seven features corresponding to different resource dimensions and provide an integrated set of resource metrics. Econometric analysis is then conducted to test our conceptual model. Our results reveal that informational, skill-related and social resources possessed by knowledge contributor relate significantly and positively to the value of knowledge content. Our results also confirm the moderating role of social resource on these relationships, providing insights into how the core elements of resources interact and reinforce each other to create value.

However, the escalating abundance of indicators makes it difficult to understand what really counts in urban sustainability and how to properly select the most suitable indicators. By methodically collecting and mapping the diversity of available indicators, our work aims to elucidate the emphases, as well as the gaps, that exist in the way urban sustainability is currently translated into metrics, and to draw instructive lessons to support the development of future indicator sets. Representing the most comprehensive study ever performed in the field, this analysis relies on both an innovative research approach entailing multi- and cross-typological systematic analysis of indicators and an extensive data sample comprising 67 indicator sets (for a total of 2847 indicators) from academia and practice. The findings highlight the most frequent indicators in urban sustainability measurement initiatives, and demonstrate the prominence of social issues (e.g., quality of life, access to services, consumer behaviour, employment) and to a lesser extent, of environmental stakes. In contrast, urban sustainability indicator sets generally pay marginal attention to political questions (e.g., participation, policies, institutional settings), gender issues and distributional concerns. From a systemic point of view, the analysis reveals the strong emphasis placed on the status of actual and potential resources as well as the satisfaction of current needs. The study further highlights seven key lessons on how to deal with three typical tensions faced during indicator selection processes: (i) parsimony vs. comprehensiveness; (ii) context-specificity vs. general comparability; and (iii) complexity vs. simplicity.

Dimensions related to where an organisation is on an innovation spectrum, how fast is that organisation innovating and what is holding it back are key elements that could be used to adequately measure innovation. The objective of this work is to explore the development of an innovation metric based on a pipe flow analogy that has the potential to provide insights into these key elements describing innovation. Methodology: This work follows three steps: establishing a hypothesis, testing the hypothesis and applying the hypothesis. The proposed hypothesis suggests that an innovation metric, Ri, can be developed based on a pipe flow analogy. This hypothesis is tested qualitatively and quantitatively. The quantitative assessment is accomplished by populating the innovation metric, Ri, with data mainly from the World Bank, comparing the results with established innovation and competitiveness metrics and examining if the metric confirms the trends suggested by the qualitative assessment. Using an illustrative case drawn from the quantitative assessment, the resulting innovation metric is used to indicate possible avenues for innovation performance improvement. Statistical analysis is limited to describing the goodness of fit of different trend line relationships. Results: A qualitative assessment indicates that the innovation metric (Ri) behaves as illustrated in the literature. The quantitative assessment confirms the qualitative assessment results. The illustrative case demonstrates how the innovation metric can be used to potentially orient innovation performance improvement. The paper closes with a discussion addressing issues and limitations of the metric. Research limitations/implications: The validity of this innovation metric is limited by the variables defining it and the quality of the data input. Consequently, the variables used are limited to the analogous versions of fluid mechanics variables used to describe fluid flow in a pipe. The variables used require both hard and soft data which was obtained from the data sources cited as related to nations. On the other hand, the subsequent challenge is related to applying this model to ever smaller organisations especially with respect to gathering soft data related to trust and ease of communication. Practical implications: Keeping in mind the limitations mentioned, the innovation metric, as it stands, can be used to describe an organisation’s innovation performance, the speed of innovation and resistance to innovation with the data available from the sites indicated. As a result, the model also can be used to see how an organisation’s innovation performance evolves over time as well as indicate possible avenues to improve innovation performance. Originality/value: This is the first application of the fluid mechanics analogy to describe innovation performance. Its main value is related to contributing to the global conversation on innovation. © 2020, The Author(s).","Fluid mechanics; Innovation; Organisations; Reynolds number","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085656329"

While conventional PRO applications target seawater (SW) /freshwater solution pairings, this paper focuses on an innovative high salinity gradient PRO application for waterflooding (WF) in the petroleum industry. WF is an industry-wide practice wherein produced water (PW) or SW is injected into the geological formation to displace hydrocarbons and increase oil production at the wellhead. PW represents the largest volume waste stream in oil production and harnessing its osmotic energy in a PRO application converts that waste stream into an asset leading to higher oil production while simultaneously reducing pumping energy requirements and enhancing injectivity. In this application, hypersaline PW at 28% total dissolved solids (TDS) is the draw solution and SW at 3.5% TDS is the feed. In contrast with hydroturbine (HT) & reverse osmosis (RO) applications where the economic benefit is energy, in WF, the primary benefit is additional oil production and a secondary benefit is energy savings. With the PW/SW solution pairing, PRO economics were compared for the WF, HT, and RO applications. The key economic metric is the “dollars of economic benefit derived per module per year” and for WF, that benefit is estimated at $71,700/module-year while the HT and RO configurations were found to return <$500/module-yr. Based on these findings, it is recommended that the application of PRO for WF be investigated further, to better define pretreatment requirements, commercial membrane performance limits and other environmental considerations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Blue energy; Oil & gas industry; Pressure-retarded osmosis; Produced water; Waterflooding","Economic and social effects; Energy conservation; Enhanced recovery; Offshore oil well production; Osmosis; Wellheads; Commercial membranes; Enhanced oil recovery; Environmental considerations; Geological formation; Membrane-based process; Pressure retarded osmosis (PRO); Pressure-retarded osmosis; Total dissolved solids; enhanced oil recovery; innovation; oil production; pump; reverse osmosis; salinity; turbine; wastewater treatment; Petroleum industry","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086506531"

This paper focuses on the relationships between the Quintuple Helix and System Dynamics modelling from a quantitative perspective.

Identification of structural features within Causal Loop Diagrams through Network Analysis is likely to provide new insights into the emergent properties of an innovation system seen as a complex system.

Formal incentive systems have proven to be effective in motivating executional behavior. Using such systems to motivate creativity is more challenging because useful creativity and innovation are notoriously difficult to measure, and use of flawed systems can produce negative outcomes. Further an innovation’s success is usually determined by the efforts of teams, not individual employees. But well-designed incentive systems, which use good measures and also allow for some slack and toleration of short-term failures, can be effective. Metrics can also serve an information role, by providing opportunities to exchange ideas, providing performancerelated feedback, and enhancing individual and group accountability. The chapter concludes by discussing how the use of incentive systems in combination with other management controls can help make organizations ambidextrous; i.e., good at both execution and innovation. © 2021 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

Therefore, companies are increasingly aligning their supply chain with business goals due to their impact on the firm's performance. Researchers acknowledge the importance of managing supply chain performance (SCP) in achieving greater customer experience and retention, increased cost-competitiveness, gaining market share with faster product innovation. Hence measuring and managing SCP is critical for a firm's business success. Though existing literature has explored key performance indicators (KPI) in measuring SCP but has rarely studied the interactions among the key SCP metrics and subsequent impact of overall SCP. To address the gap, present research work aimed to identify key metrics, rank them, investigate mutual relationship and propose integrated SCP metrics. Understanding the interrelationship among SCP metrics will enable supply chain practitioners in well-aligned decision making. To achieve this, a hybrid exploratory three-phased multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) model is adopted. The qualitative Delphi technique is initially applied to identify the critical SCP metrics, followed by Best-Worst Method (BWM) to rank SCP metrics, completed by decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method to establish the mutual relationship among the SCP metrics. The research finding, based on the study conducted for mining and earth-moving machinery manufacturing industry, suggests that sub-metrics such as flexibility in meeting customer needs, customer perceived value, operating cost of SC, employee productivity, range of products and services, are significantly contributing to the overall SCP.

However, due to the dearth of available data, not much empirical evidence has been provided. This paper aims to empirically assess the impacts of Airbnb on hotel performances in South Africa. Design/methodology/approach: Using South Africa as a case study, the study measures the impacts of Airbnb on hotel performances on three key metrics, namely, room prices, occupancy and Revenue per available room (RevPAR). A difference-in-difference model is estimated using a population-based data set of 809 hotels from 2016 to 2018. Findings: The results reveal that despite Airbnb significantly and negatively impacting on hotel occupancies it has a non-significant effect on hotel prices and RevPAR. Although from the theoretical perspective a disruptive innovation business model such as Airbnb can possibly have a negligible effect on hotel performances because it may attract a different group of customers and create a new market, the empirical findings of this study fail to support this theoretical hypothesis. Consequently, the findings diverge with newly developed knowledge in other markets and point to nuanced and contextual complementary effects. Research limitations/implications: Although some interesting findings are revealed into his study, some caveats remain. For instance, the study relied on data from hotels not from Airbnb. If the data of Airbnb can become available, it would be interesting to further examine whether the aggregated RevPAR of Airbnb can compensate for the aggregated loss of hotel RevPAR. This type of analysis could provide a broader evaluation scope regarding the overall effect of Airbnb on hotel performances. Moreover, if a longer time series data set of hotels in the post-Airbnb time period could become available, it would be interesting to further investigate the time-varying dynamic effects of Airbnb on hotel performances. Practical implications: While hotels have launched a campaign to portray Airbnb as being commercial operators looking to compete illegally with hotels for the same segment of customers, this study shows that the rhetoric has been exaggerated. Airbnb, and more broadly, vacation rentals do not represent a war with hotels. They represent an answer to a different need. Indeed, the study reveals that Airbnb’s offer is a mere supplement to the market contrary to media rhetoric that it is meant to substitute hotels. The study has several implications for practitioners. First, these results are important because they serve as evidence against news articles that claim Airbnb is driving hotels out of business. They also show that if current trends continue, employees in the hotel industry in South Africa do not need to be concerned about losing their jobs because of Airbnb’s emergence. It is also important information for investors who may be concerned that Airbnb is hurting the hotel industry’s bottom line. Second, as the share of Airbnb listings on the accommodation market varies dramatically between cities, it is likely that eventual regulations/restrictions should be introduced in the provincial levels, while most of the cities continue benefiting from the increasing number of Airbnb visitors. Originality/value: To the best of the author’s knowledge, this study is the first in South Africa to provide empirical evidence that Airbnb is significantly changing consumption patterns in the hotel industry, as opposed to generating purely incremental economic activity. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","ADR; Airbnb; Disruptive innovation; Home sharing; Hotel performances; RevPAR; South Africa","South Africa; data set; economic activity; hotel industry; innovation; performance assessment; time series analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075497756"

Factory planning projects initiated for the production of innovative products are particularly affected. For these products, there is almost no historical or empirical data available, so the forecasts can only be based on estimated influencing variables and data from similar products. Accordingly, the risk that the selected capacity does not match the actual market demand is higher. While the capacity of a factory represents a long-term investment decision, the spread of innovations can fail within a short timeframe or occur far below the expected level. For this reason, it can be assumed that insights from innovation research offer a planning advantage in forecasting the production potential. Regarding an increasing number of global product innovations, the evaluation of empirical data by means of suitable models and methods is becoming more and more accurate in order to reflect typical market patterns based on recurring customer behaviour.

Specifically, the method quantitatively identifies the important but unsatisfied customer needs by analyzing online review data. To represent customer needs in a structured form, the job-to-be-done-based customer outcomes are adopted from the outcome-driven innovation (ODI) framework. Therefore, job-to-be-done information is extracted from the review data and is transformed into customer outcomes. The outcomes having high service opportunities are selected by metrics for quantifying the importance and satisfaction score of the outcomes. This paper conducted an empirical study for hotel service using relevant review data. The results show that the method can identify customer needs in hotel service—e.g., maximizing safety to pay price/deposit, and maximizing possibility to avoid waiting at lobby—and objectively prioritize strategic directions for service innovation. Therefore, the proposed method can be used as an intelligent tool for the effective development of a business strategy. © 2021 by the authors.

But the farmers are facing plenty of problems like rainfall shortage, animals mischievous, soil moisturizer, that causes poor production of yield. More than 65% of the crops yields in Tamil Nadu mainly depend upon seasonal rainfall. A modern innovation in Information and Communication Technology for agricultural sector is a fascinating research domain to predict/forecast the productivity of cultivation with respect to rainfall. The crisis of productivity forecasting is a key research area and can be done based on the historical dataset. Machine learning algorithms like random forest, support vector can be used for the prediction of rainfall or cultivation yield. The objective of this paper is to use different machine learning algorithms to forecast rainfall for raising the yield production in south Tamil Nadu particularly in Madurai. The experiment is conducted with monsoon dataset 4116 rows and 19 attributes and result is evaluated by using several metrics—Root mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE) and R2 score.

Internationalised R&D is especially attractive to firms in developing countries who tend to lack exposure to advanced technologies. A series of studies found that firms who undertake internationalised R&D are more profitable, and some claimed that, overall, it increases patent output. Yet rarely have we studied how the different aspects of internationalised R&D influence technological innovation output. Fewer studies still have paid attention to internationalised R&D in China as the world's largest developing economy and a significant international competitor. Therefore, we conducted a study on the relationship between key components of internationalised R&D and technological innovation output in listed Chinese multinationals. From a literature review and cross-case analysis of four Chinese tech giants, we established network construction and knowledge acquisition as key processes in internationalised R&D, and technological and geographic diversity as key characteristics. We then defined a regression model and metrics and analysed a sample of 40 listed Chinese firms to determine how those characteristics relate and interrelate to the number of international patents held by each firm. The results show positive correlations for all hypothesis tests. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","geographic diversity; internationalised R&D; technological diversity; technological innovation output","China; competitiveness; correlation; developing world; empirical analysis; innovation; multinational enterprise; research and development; technological development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089590857"

Niche skills processed by freelancers could help startups reduce uncertainties associated with developments and markets, with the ability to quickly address market issues (and with higher quality). This requires the associations between freelancers and startup to be long-term, based on trust, and promising agreements driven by motivations (leading to the growth of both parties). Freelancers could help startups foster innovations and undertake software development tasks in better ways than conducted in-house, if they are selected using informed decision-making. Objectives: the paper has three objectives, (1) to explore the strategies of startups to outsource software development tasks to freelancers (termed as freelancing association strategies); (2) to identify challenges in such outsourcings; and (3) to identify the impacts of outsourcing tasks to freelancers on overall project metrics. The overall objective is to understand the strategies for involving freelancers in the software development process, throughout the startup lifecycle, and the associated challenges and the impacts that help to foster innovation (to maintain competitive advantages). Method: this paper performs empirical studies through case studies of three software startups located in Italy, France, and India, followed by a survey of 54 freelancers. The results are analyzed and compared in the identification of association models, issues, challenges, and reported results arising because of such associations. The case study results are validated using members checking with the research participants, which shows a higher level of result agreements. Results: the results indicate that the freelancer association strategy is task based, panel based, or a hybrid. The associations are constrained by issues such as deciding pricing, setting deadlines, difficulty in getting good freelancers, quality issues with software artefacts, and efforts to access freelancer work submissions for reward. The associations have a positive impact on software development if there is availability of good freelancers (which lasts long for various tasks). The paper finally provides a freelancing model framework and recommends activities that could result in making the situation beneficial to both parties, and streamline such associations. Fostering innovation in startups is, thus, a trade-off situation, which is limited and supported by many conflicting parameters. © 2020 by the authors.

They could help companies (including startups) to foster innovations by suggesting creative ideas and providing their expertise in implementing them (for instance, designing solutions, coding solutions etc.). Freelancers could effectively and efficiently work as a virtual member of the software development team. The company must make informed decisions about which task to allot to the freelancer, which freelancer to select, pricing the task, and evaluating the submitted work. On the other hand, the freelancer should make an informed decision about evaluating the monetary value of the task to be charged, trusting the requester, analyzing the skills requirement of the task (finding matches between skill requirement and skills processed), selecting the best task, and maintaining the highest level of reputation. However, the literature does not provide freelancers and the companies the guidelines that support their decision making. However, if freelancers are selected carefully for the most suitable task, the companies will benefit a lot in terms of improved software development metrics. [Objectives] The objective of this paper is to provide the research community the research trends in freelancer-supported software development. This helps to understand that which software development areas have higher concentrations of research efforts, which area has the support of empirical evidence to support management decision makings, and which area requires the research attention. [Method] The systematic study is conducted by planning the mapping protocol, executing the protocol, and reporting the findings using various visualization tools like bar charts and pie charts. The search process was planned to be executed using set of inclusion and exclusion conditions on four bibliographic databases (IEEExplore, Springerlink, Sciencedirect, and ACM digital library). The relevant papers are selected by applying inclusion and exclusion conditions. The google citations of the relevant papers are subject to the inclusion and exclusion conditions again to include the more relevant papers. Finally, the systematic schema was created and populated after analyzing the studies abstracts. [Results] The results indicate the following (a) The research focus is on generic software development (78%) rather on individual life cycle activities. (b) The number of empirical studies is limited (25%). (c) A number of studies proposing solutions and evaluating on live cases in industrial settings are missing from the literature. This is in comparison to the validation approaches (72%) i.e., solutions tested in laboratory settings. (d) At present, the literature has limited ability to provide the software companies (including startups) with the guidelines (in the form of opinions and experience reports) for involving freelancers in the software development process. (e) The reported challenges include Collaboration and Coordination (33%), Developer Recommendation (or selection) (19%), Team Formulation (14%), Task Recommendation (allocation) (14%), Task Decomposition (11%), Privacy and Security (Confidentiality) (11%), Budget Estimation (8%), Recognition (8%), Trust Issues (8%), Market Dynamism (6%), Intellectual Property Issues (6%), Participation of Crowd Worker (6%), and Capacity Utilization (3%). These challenges are highly interactive, and each challenge impacts all other challenges. (e) Recent focus of the researchers (total 7 studies in 2019) is on generic software development handling the collaboration and coordination (3 studies out of 7), Developer recommendation (2 studies out of 7), and task recommendation (2 studies out of 7). [Conclusion] The freelancer-driven software engineering research area has got the attraction of the researchers, but it will take a long time to gain maturity. This puts an urgent call for more empirical studies and evaluation-based solution research that could help companies (including startups) to foster innovations. Further, the research focus should be well distributed among the various development phases to address the unique challenges associated with individual activities. The accurate management of the freelancer in the software development could help companies and startups to foster innovations and remain competitive in the marketplace. © 2020 by the authors.

The National Primary Care Strategy (2001) in Ireland is a top down policy for primary healthcare reform, which prioritised the development and implementation of interdisciplinary Primary Care Teams. The number of Primary Care Teams and features of their clinical meetings have been the key metric in Ireland for appraising progress with the implementation of the strategy. However, these have been challenging to organise in practice. The aim of this paper is to analyse empirical evidence of other forms of interdisciplinary working in Irish primary care, using Normalisation Process Theory. Drawing on data from an on-line survey (71 GPs and 498 other healthcare professionals), and an interview study (37 participants; 8 GPs, 7 practice managers/admin support and 22 health care professionals) in three of the four Health Service Executive (HSE) regions in Ireland, we analyse the nature of these other forms of interdisciplinary working and describe innovations for service delivery that have been developed ‘from the ground up’ as a result. We examine levers and barriers to the implementation of these bottom up innovations. The levers are that these innovations make sense to professionals, are based on local needs and focus on preventive patient-centred care. They are driven forward by small groups of professionals from different backgrounds with complementary skills. The evaluations show positive impacts of the innovative services for patients, however, many have ceased to operate due to negative effects of the recent economic recession on the Irish healthcare system. These flexible and localised innovations were shaped in part by the reforms set out in the 2001 Primary Care Strategy but also represent unintended effects of that policy because they are the result of bottom up interdisciplinary working that occurs alongside, or instead of, Primary Care Team clinical meetings. Furthermore, as they not captured by existing metrics, the interdisciplinary work and resultant services have been ‘invisible’ to senior management and policy makers. If appropriately acknowledged and supported, they can shape primary care in the future. © 2019","Innovation; Interdisciplinary team working; Normalisation Process Theory; Policy implementation; Primary care teams; Primary health care","Adult; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Health Care Reform; Humans; Ireland; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Care Team; Patient-Centered Care; Preventive Medicine; Primary Health Care; Qualitative Research; Surveys and Questionnaires; adult; article; clinical article; controlled study; drawing; economic recession; female; health care system; human; interview; Ireland; male; manager; patient care; primary health care; skill; system analysis; health care delivery; health care policy; middle aged; preventive medicine; primary health care; qualitative research; questionnaire","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072713261"

Particularly, people living in rural areas suffer from a lack of health infrastructure, which would jeopardize their inclusion in universal coverage for specialist care. Delivering valuable healthcare in underserved areas can be achieved through the employment of new technical innovations, such as telemedicine, which improves service delivery processes. Accordingly, this paper discusses how telemedicine strategies have enhanced the sustainability of right of ""access to healthcare"" in rural areas. Once we derived the sustainability pillars for healthcare from the UN-SDGs 3 and 10 according to the WHO innovation assessment metrics, a PRISMA-based literature review was conducted using the Scopus database. English, peer-reviewed articles/reviews from 1973 to 2019 were considered. The enquiry covers two analyses: (i) quantitative-bibliometric on 2267 papers; and (ii) qualitative-narrative on the 30 most significant papers. Interest about the topic has increased in the last decade following digitalization diffusion. The most productive and collaborative countries are those with huge dimensions and under financial restrictions. From a sustainability-oriented standpoint, telemedicine enhances both emergency and diagnostic healthcare in rural areas by decreasing the cost of services, expanding coverage of specialist cares, and increasing the quality of the outcomes. For health policies, telemedicine can be considered a suitable solution for providing cost-effective and sustainable healthcare. © 2020 by the authors.","Access to healthcare; Commons; E-health; Health-related performance; Remote areas; Rural areas; Telemedicine; UN-SDG 10; UN-SDG 3; Value-based healthcare","Scopus; employment; health care; health policy; innovation; literature review; medicine; rural area; sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; United Nations","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084675156"

A better understanding of the techniques of AI employed and of the sports that are using AI is clearly warranted. The purpose of this study is to identify which AI approaches have been applied to investigate sport performance and injury risk and to find out which AI techniques each sport has been using. Methods: Systematic searches through the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science online databases were conducted for articles reporting AI techniques or methods applied to team sports athletes. Results: Fifty-eight studies were included in the review with 11 AI techniques or methods being applied in 12 team sports. Pooled sample consisted of 6456 participants (97% male, 25 ± 8 years old; 3% female, 21 ± 10 years old) with 76% of them being professional athletes. The AI techniques or methods most frequently used were artificial neural networks, decision tree classifier, support vector machine, and Markov process with good performance metrics for all of them. Soccer, basketball, handball, and volleyball were the team sports with more applications of AI. Conclusions: The results of this review suggest a prevalent application of AI methods in team sports based on the number of published studies.

These are the increase of operating temperatures and of the power plant's overall efficiency, as well as the cost reductions of the solar field by eliminating components and the reduction of parasitic power consumption (Pitz-Paal et al., 2007). The study investigates 34 collector concepts and classifies them according to their main structural features like mechanisms or materials. The categories include conventional collectors in Category A, collectors with alternative structure and sheet reflectors in Category B, with non-metallic materials like sandwich composite structures and concrete in Category C, with enclosed aperture in Category D and with fixed focus in Category E. For the technical-economic comparison, two conventional collectors vs. 14 innovations are analysed, following a design engineering method. The definition of a metric table defines the technical comparison criteria for those collectors suitable for thermo-oils or molten salts as heat transfer fluid. Results show that collectors operating with molten salts, instead of thermo-oil, have a significant techno-economic potential for utility scale application, for instance, the Molten Salt Trough, the UltimateTrough and the SkyFuelDSP (dispatchable solar power) as forerunners of their respective categories. Results show also that the inflatable Heliovis collector operating with thermo-oil has a relevant economic potential. © 2020 International Solar Energy Society","Concentrated solar power; Innovation; Molten salt; Parabolic trough collector; Parasitic consumption; Solar field costs; Technical-economic evaluation","Composite structures; Cost reduction; Energy efficiency; Fused salts; Heat transfer; Solar collectors; Alternative structure; Comparison criterion; Economic comparisons; Economic potentials; Large-scale applications; Operating temperature; Parabolic trough collectors; Parasitic power consumption; comparative study; cost analysis; design; economic analysis; heat transfer; innovation; reduction; salt; Solar power plants","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099482593"

This is especially true for a university, like Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), known both for higher education innovation and supporting underprivileged student populations. One of the major obstacles in these areas for SNHU is the manual process students go through to acquire access to their course materials in purchasing them through the online bookstore. Not only does this lead to higher prices on materials but also creates unnecessary steps students have to complete in order to be prepared for learning. In a population of students who already face a number of barriers to completing their education, resource acquisition became an opportunity for SNHU to impact students to help them succeed, rather than impede their progress. In late 2017, SNHU began exploring options for inclusive access. This case provides insight into the process by which the team at SNHU performed initial research and discovery, formed a project proposal and team, planned and implemented a pilot of inclusive access, gathered pilot metrics and data, and prepared for future expansion of the program. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Affordability; Brainstorming; Considerations; ETexts; Goals; Higher education; Inclusive access; Interviews; Metrics; New hampshire; Stakeholders; Technology","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089631259"

Even though it has been 17 years, Current Research Information Systems (CRISs) are still being adopted and implemented to transfer innovation and research to industry and society. European Open Science cloud aims to solve problems with interoperability and fragmentation of CRISs and to achieve common standards for Open Science implementation in EU.Several reports show the current state of transition to Open Science in European Countries such as European University Association (EUA) report. However, the current state of research assessment in Balkan universities is not included in most of the surveys. The paper aims to fill this gap by investigating current situation with Open Science adoption in Bulgarian and Albanian Universities. The structure of the paper is very similar to EUA report in order to facilitate a comparison of these universities to other universities in Europe.It presents the spread of open access science; the state of progress to make research publications and data open, as well as challenges Bulgarian and Albanian university academics face to have an open approach to research assessment. In conclusion, it is shown that Bulgarian and Albanian researchers fully support Open Science and Open Access practices but most of the time they lack incentives and/or Open Access mandates on their universities.

The suitability of LED devices for plant cultivation has turned the technology into a main component in controlled or closed plant-growing environments, experiencing an extremely fast development of horticulture LED metrics. In this context, the present study aims to provide an insight into the current global horticulture LED industry and the present features and potentialities for LEDs' applications. An updated review of this industry has been integrated through a database compilation of 301 manufacturers and 1473 LED lighting systems for plant growth. The research identifies Europe (40%) and North America (29%) as the main regions for production. Additionally, the current LED luminaires' lifespans show 10 and 30% losses of light output after 45,000 and 60,000 working hours on average, respectively, while the vast majority of worldwide LED lighting systems present efficacy values ranging from 2 to 3 μmol J-1 (70%).

In particular, the changing behaviors towards sustainability issues of the global community and the availability of environmental, social and governance (ESG) indicators are attracting investors to socially responsible investment decisions. Furthermore, whereas the strategic importance of ESG metrics has been particularly studied for private enterprises, little attention have received public companies. To address this gap, the present work has three aims-1. To predict the accuracy of main financial indicators such as the expected Return of Equity (ROE) and Return of Assets (ROA) of public enterprises in Europe based on ESG indicators and other economic metrics; 2. To identify whether ESG initiatives affect the financial performance of public European enterprises; and 3. To discuss how ESG factors, based on the findings of aims #1 and #2, can contribute to the advancements of the current debate on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policies and practices in public enterprises in Europe. To fulfil the above aims, we use a combined approach of machine learning (ML) techniques and inferential (i.e., ordered logistic regression) model. The former predicts the accuracy of ROE and ROA on several ESG and other economic metrics and fulfils aim #1. The latter is used to test whether any causal relationships between ESG investment decisions and ROA and ROE exist and, whether these relationships exist, to assess their magnitude. The inferential analysis fulfils aim #2. Main findings suggest that ML accurately predicts ROA and ROE and indicate, through the ordered logistic regression model, the existence of a positive relationship between ESG practices and the financial indicators. In addition, the existing relationship appears more evident when companies invest in environmental innovation, employment productivity and diversity and equal opportunity policies. As a result, to fulfil aim #3 useful policy insights are advised on these issues to strengthen CSR strategies and sustainable development practices in European public enterprises. © 2020 by the authors.","ESG; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Public enterprises; Return of assets; Return of equity","Europe; corporate social responsibility; employment generation; equity; financial provision; human capital; industrial enterprise; industrial performance; innovation; logistics; machine learning; regression analysis; Sustainable Development Goal","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087887109"

However, there are some problems associated with the widely used everyday practices of sampling, estimation and use of cyanobacteria when calculating phytoplankton indices assessing water quality. Many indices were developed during the implementation of the Water Framework Directive, considered the most innovative European environmental legislation. Most indices include cyanobacteria as a composition or bloom metric. Problems with the indices concern the exclusion of most chroococcalean taxa from cyanobacterial biovolume estimations in lakes and reservoirs of the Mediterranean region, treatment of the mucilage of colonial chroococcalean taxa in biovolume estimations and overlooking of deep-water cyanobacterial blooms due to sampling depth. These problems may lead to a biased view of water quality. In this paper we argue in favour of including all cyanobacteria taxa and their mucilage in biovolume estimations and considering a sampling depth that covers deep-water maxima, such as those formed by Planktothrix rubescens or colonial chroococcalean taxa. © 2020 CSIRO.","Cyanodictyon imperfectum; euphotic zone; Greece; Merismopedia tenuissima; Secchi depth; Water Framework Directive; WFD","Chroococcales; Cyanobacteria; Merismopedia tenuissima; Planktothrix rubescens; assessment method; cyanobacterium; innovation; phytoplankton; pollution monitoring; water quality","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076391640"

The delivery of energy-efficient buildings requires an integrated design that considers climate, technology, operation and maintenance, and occupant behavior. Previous research to reconcile human-building interaction has focused on two or three system interactions with the occupant, improving the accuracy of building controls systems to match occupant demand or manage energy use, changing the user interface to alter human behavior, and understanding the effects of indoor environmental quality on human performance. This work presents a structured process to systematically study the complex interactions between multiple building subsystems and the occupant, as well as capture their multifaceted effects on humans and various building performance outcomes. Derived from systems theory, this process illustrates the dynamic interactions between the human and technical parts and processes of building systems to provide a holistic lens on human-building interaction, building systems integration, and the resulting building performance. The findings illustrate the opportunity to design independent building systems in view of their interactions, resulting effects on humans, and whole-building outcomes/performance goals. The findings conclude that independent building subsystem outputs have functional, social, and emotional effects on humans that are not intentionally captured in the traditional building design metrics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Building innovation; Complex systems; Socio-technical systems; Sustainable building design; Systems thinking","Architectural design; Behavioral research; Carbon dioxide; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Global warming; Intelligent buildings; Quality control; User interfaces; Building performance; Carbon dioxide emissions; Energy efficient building; Indoor environmental quality; Low-carbon societies; Operation and maintenance; Subsystem performance; Traditional buildings; building; energy use; holistic approach; indoor air; innovation; performance assessment; Structural design","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084557368"

The purpose of this research work is to study the selection of the performance metrics based on the preferences, and find out what metrics are prioritized in a current strategic plan and how to translate big data insights into meaningful managerial actions. The authors prioritized group commitments and commitment of KPIs in the case study of universities in Mongolia, using the AHP approach for multi-criteria decision makings. Hardcopy questionnaire and interview sessions were used for collecting data to analyse the prioritization results. Based on the prioritization results of strategies, we find that decision-makers strongly prefer strategies with the goals and this preference causes the imbalance of metrics on the dashboard. The prioritization of metrics is highly influenced by the data availability of management reporting. Prioritization of performance metrics are data-driven and bring bottom-up impacts on the dynamics of the strategic plan. The conflicted interests of stakeholders, internal policy, and the excessive amount of metrics make strategic decision makings difficult. The application of AHP in the case study contributes to improving the speed of decision-making processes, providing scientific results on KPIs prioritization and selection, and providing an approach to assess the differences between what strategic planners think and what they execute and prioritize on a practical level. The prioritization of performance metrics is the sustainable approach that can be extended to other strategic decision makings as well, for example prioritizing business model elements or business processes. This research work proves that the multi-criteria decision-making approach AHP can be used to prioritize and identify strategic focus based on selections of the performance metrics. The research also demonstrates the importance of combining bottom-up data-driven analytics with top-down strategy-making processes in big data developments. © 2020 Global IT Research Institute - GIRI.","decision making; KPIs; metrics; performance; strategy","Benchmarking; Big data; Hierarchical systems; Strategic planning; Surveys; Decision making process; Key performance indicators; Managerial actions; Multi criteria decision making; Performance metrics; Scientific results; Selection and optimizations; Strategic decision making; Decision making","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083983174"

Design Thinking is an innovative approach to problem-solving that leverages insights from the end-users of new products, services, and experiences in order to develop best-fit solutions that are rapidly prototyped and iteratively refined. When compared to traditional problem-solving methods in health care and other public health adjacent fields, Design Thinking leads to more successful and sustainable interventions. Design Thinking has facilitated improvements in patient, provider, and community satisfaction, and in public health, has increased efficiency and collaboration in intervention development. Given the promising nature of Design Thinking as an effective problem-solving method, it follows that Design Thinking training would prove a beneficial addition to public health education. The integration of Design Thinking in public health education may equip public health leaders with essential skills necessary to understand and more effectively approach historically intractable challenges. This article describes the development and evaluation of a hands-on Design Thinking workshop, piloted with Master of Public Health (MPH) students in April, 2019 at Thomas Jefferson University. Preceding and following the workshop, evaluation forms were used to assess participants' knowledge about Design Thinking concepts and attitudes towards the workshop experience. Metrics were aligned with established learning objectives related to process, impact, and outcomes of the workshop. We hypothesized that the workshop intervention would increase participants understanding of Design Thinking concepts and applications in public health. Evaluations demonstrated that after attending the workshop, participants were able to understand and apply Design Thinking concepts in a public health context. Following the evaluation of pilot data, the workshop was refined and embedded in the MPH curriculum at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, PA. © Copyright © 2020 Abookire, Plover, Frasso and Ku.","design thinking; education; human-centered design; innovation; public health","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090785306"

Worldwide wheat (Triticum Linnaeus) (Poaceae) production in 2018-2019 was estimated at over 700 million metric tons in 2018-2019. Wheat midge, Sitodiplosis mosellana (Géhin) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), a serious insect pest of wheat, is widely distributed in many parts of the world where wheat production occurs. Macroglenes penetrans (Kirby) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), a parasitoid of S. mosellana, has successfully established in most wheat midge-infested areas. Mechanistic, or process-based, population models were used in this study to assess the interactive population dynamics of the three species, based on their respective life cycles and meteorological factors. The models were validated with survey data from multiple sites over numerous years (1991-2016). These simulation models helped to detail our understanding of the tri-trophic population dynamics and will help guide pest management decisions both prior to the growing season and until wheat heading, when wheat is no longer susceptible to S. mosellana. The associated models also help identify gaps in system knowledge, provide a foundation for evaluating future innovative management options, and evaluate the potential impact of a changing climate. © 2020 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.","","Cecidomyiidae; Chironomidae; Diptera; Hexapoda; Hymenoptera; Poaceae; Pteromalidae; Sitodiplosis mosellana; Triticum; Triticum aestivum; growing season; innovation; insect; life cycle; natural enemy; parasitoid; pest control; pest species; population dynamics; simulation; wheat","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083214045"

HF requires that 4–6 million gallons per well (15,000–23,000 m3/well) of water be pumped underground to stimulate the release of entrapped hydrocarbons from unconventional (i.e., shale or carbonate) formations. Estimated U.S. produced water volumes exceed 150 billion gallons/year across the industry from unconventional wells alone and are projected to grow for at least another two decades. Concerns over the environmental impact from accidental or incidental release of produced water from HF wells (“U-PW”), along with evolving regulatory and economic drivers, has spurred great interest in technological innovation to enhance U-PW recycling and reuse. In this review, we analyze U-PW quantity and composition based on the latest U.S. Geographical Survey data, identify key contamination metrics useful in tracking water quality improvement in the context of HF operations, and suggest “fit-for-purpose treatment” to enhance cost-effective regulatory compliance, water recovery/reuse, and resource valorization. Drawing on industrial practice and technoeconomic constraints, we further assess the challenges associated with U-PW treatment for onshore U.S. operations. Presented are opportunities for targeted end-uses of treated U-PW. We highlight emerging technologies that may enhance cost-effective U-PW management as HF activities grow and evolve in the coming decades. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Flowback and produced water; Hydraulic fracturing; Shale gas; Shale oil; Water reuse; Water treatment technologies","Goals; Hydraulic Fracking; Natural Gas; Oil and Gas Fields; United States; Waste Water; Water Wells; United States; Cost effectiveness; Environmental impact; Hydraulic fracturing; Produced Water; Regulatory compliance; Shale gas; Shale oil; Wastewater reclamation; Water conservation; Water quality; Water recycling; carbonic acid; hydrocarbon; water; natural gas; well water; Emerging technologies; Flowback; Industrial practices; Oil and gas fields; Technological innovation; Water quality improvements; Water reuse; Water treatment technologies; environmental impact; formation water; gas field; hydraulic fracturing; industrial practice; innovation; oil shale; recycling; valorization; wastewater treatment; water quality; cost effectiveness analysis; economic aspect; environmental impact; fracking; oil and gas field; oil shale; priority journal; Review; United States; waste water recycling; water contamination; water quality; water supply; fracking; motivation; waste water; Water treatment","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078537544"

A localist paradigm—encompassing models such as community-based management, citizen science, and cooperative research—offers a promising approach for bridging governance gaps by engaging citizens, co-producing knowledge, fostering trust, and developing innovative solutions to address complex conservation challenges. Yet, despite notable successes, significant barriers constrain widespread implementation of localist approaches. This is particularly evident in natural resource-dependent communities. Rural communities are increasingly faced with a range of conservation challenges related to rapid climate and land-use changes but often they lack the capacity to support locally based initiatives to better anticipate, plan for, and mitigate these changes. We examined four diverse conservation cases based on localist approaches in Maine, USA, to bring to the fore key factors that influence outcomes in different social-ecological contexts. We compared cases along three frequently discussed dimensions—governance systems, social adaptive capacities, and technology and data characteristics and found that localist outcomes vary widely depending on key metrics within each of these dimensions. There is no single way to advance localism, but we offer multiple ways to incorporate a community-based perspective into management. This synthesis of data from our collective participatory research projects provides guidance to maximize the potential of localist conservation approaches in complex social and biophysical arenas. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Community-based conservation; Governance systems; Localism; Social adaptive capacities","Conservation of Natural Resources; Natural Resources; Maine; United States; Land use; Adaptive capacity; Community based solution; Community-based management; Data characteristics; Governance systems; Innovative solutions; Localist approach; Participatory research; adaptive management; federal system; governance approach; innovation; land use change; local participation; article; climate; human; land use; Maine; natural resource; outcome assessment; participatory research; rural population; synthesis; environmental protection; natural resource; Historic preservation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096107246"

SHRM ensures the company has the number of employees and systems with the levels and types of skills required to promote and achieve the goals of the company's strategic plan. Talent management considers the people and talent acquisition analytics consisting of recruitment and succession planning. The playbooks and platforms analytics involve incorporating technologies in workflows, retention and turnover metrics, collaborations, and training and development initiatives. Combining technology with SHRM processes leads to higher organisational performance. Innovative ways of using technologies to recruit, hire, train and develop, and retain high-potential human capital pools are sources of competitive advantages. Human resource departments and technologies are the most influential players in the strategic planning of an organisation. Therefore, management should engage in stronger complementary and autonomous roles within SHRM.

There is also evidence of hearing conservation programmes (HCPs) being implemented with limited success. Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore and document current evidence reflecting recent advances in HCPs in order to identify gaps within the South African HCPs. Method: A systematic literature review was conducted in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis. Electronic databases including Sage, Science Direct, PubMed, Scopus MEDLINE, ProQuest and Google Scholar were searched for potential studies published in English between 2010 and 2019 reporting on recent advances in HCPs within the mining industry. Results: The study findings revealed a number of important recent advances internationally, which require deliberation for possible implementation within the South African HCPs context. These advances have been presented under seven themes: (1) the use of metrics, (2) pharmacological interventions and hair cell regeneration, (3) artificial neural network, (4) audiology assessment measures, (5) noise monitoring advances, (6) conceptual approaches to HCPs and (7) buying quiet. Conclusion: The study findings raise important advances that may have significant implications for HCPs in LAMI countries where ONIHL remains a highly prevalent occupational health challenge. Establishing feasibility and efficacy of these advances in these contexts to ensure contextual relevance and responsiveness is one of the recommendations to facilitate the success of HCPs targets. © 2020.

When the innovation was introduced consumers strongly preferred white or yellow-fleshed sweetpotato, so it was necessary to create a demand to respond to that need. This was at odds with the breeding strategy of responding to consumers’ demands. Additional elements of the innovation package include seed systems and nutrition education to create the awareness amongst consumers of the significant health benefits of OFSP. Complementary innovation is required in promotion and advocacy to ensure a supportive institutional environment. Four dimensions-- technical, organizational, leadership, and institutional environment-- are explored across five distinct phases of the innovation process, from the emergence of the innovative idea (1991–1996) through scaling phase in 15 countries under a major institutional innovation (2015-mid-2019), the Sweetpotato for Profit and Health Initiative (SPHI). Systematically gathering evidence of nutritional impact and ability to scale cost-effectively was requisite for obtaining support for further development and diffusion of the crop. Positive findings from a major study coincided with a major change in the institutional environment which placed agriculture and nutrition at the forefront of the development agenda, resulting in an inflection point in both research and diffusion investment. The role of committed leadership during all phases was critical for success, but particularly during the first decade of limited support in a challenging institutional environment. The most critical technical achievement underpinning scaling was moving from 2 to 13 African countries having local breeding programs. Evidence is presented that adapted, well performing varieties which consumers prefer is the foundation for successful scaling to occur. Building a cadre of within country and regional advocates was critical for getting sustained commitment and local buy-in to the concept of biofortification by regional bodies and governments, which in turn built within country ownership and the willingness of donors to invest. The SPHI united diverse organizations under a common vision with a simple metric--- the number of households reached with improved varieties of sweetpotato. Since 2009, 6.2 million households were reached by July 2019 in 15 SSA countries. Much more remains to be done. Advocacy efforts led to the integration of nutritious foods into many national and regional policies, setting the stage for further investment. © 2019 The Authors","Biofortification; Innovation; Micronutrient malnutrition; Orange-fleshed sweetpotato; Scaling; Sub-Saharan Africa","Sub-Saharan Africa; Ipomoea batatas; agricultural production; crop improvement; education; food consumption; innovation; investment incentive; malnutrition; nutritional requirement; potato; selective breeding; state role; trace element; vitamin","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076708779"

We interpreted the subjects' eye movement behaviors on the digital slide decks. After data regularization and filtering, the results were analyzed to give directions for how to design an attractive digital learning content from the viewpoint of eye movement behaviors. The relationships between the subjects' evaluation scores, page categories, and eye movement metrics are discussed. The results demonstrated that the proposed fixation time percentage (FTP) was a representative, strong, and stable eye movement metric to measure the subjects' interest.

Assessment of innovative project is described as a two-stage process. The first step is processing the project attributes using knowledge models in order to build a set of optimality criteria. The second step is the construction of a comprehensive criterion of optimality and the use of a specific metric for comparing and ranking innovative projects. The model of production rules using fuzzy inference is considered first. The use of production rules for the logical inference of more complex criteria is proposed. The frame model of knowledge representation is considered for calculating the parameters of an innovative project, since this model supports calculations in the process of inference. An application of semantic networks is considered with a combination of node-based and arc-based inference styles. Complex rules and relationships between entities in a complex process of evaluating an innovative project are presented using a semantic network. As a last step, the combination of all the evaluated characteristics of an innovative project into one complex criterion of optimality using fuzzy sets is described. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Frames; Fuzzy set; Innovation; Innovation project; Knowledge representation; Production rules; Semantic network","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087565763"

Some objects and factors are ignored in traditional utility methods, and this narrow perspective is their primary drawback. In intelligent transportation systems, it is necessary to calculate transportation utility for promoting public traffic planning and management. To build a sustainable intelligent transportation system, modified utility methods are essential to analyze transportation utility in a comprehensive way with innovative technologies and efficient communication systems. To solve the disadvantages of traditional utility methods, it is necessary to establish a new method to build sustainable public transport in the future. In this study, the Multiple Utility Method and Transportation Utility Method are proposed for public transport planning and management from multiple perspectives. A sample is presented to provide a better description, and 69,174 GPS-equipped taxi data in Haikou are adopted for the application of the Transportation Utility Method. The results show that the transportation utility values calculated by the Transportation Utility Method are more comprehensive than the transportation utility calculated by traditional utility methods. This indicates that it is necessary to calculate transportation utility from multiple perspectives based on the Transportation Utility Method. Future directions could include improving the methods, considering more factors, expanding the data used, and extrapolating this research to other cities around the world with similar urban metrics and urban form. © 2020 by the authors.

Institutions consider how much weight to give activities in each of these areas and determine a threshold for advancement. With the emergence of social media, scholars can engage wider audiences in creative ways and have a broader impact. Conventional metrics like the h-index do not account for social media impact. Social media engagement is poorly represented in most curricula vitae (CV) and therefore is undervalued in promotion and tenure reviews. Objective: The objective was to develop crowdsourced guidelines for documenting social media scholarship. These guidelines aimed to provide a structure for documenting a scholar's general impact on social media, as well as methods of documenting individual social media contributions exemplifying innovation, education, mentorship, advocacy, and dissemination. Methods: To create unifying guidelines, we created a crowdsourced process that capitalized on the strengths of social media and generated a case example of successful use of the medium for academic collaboration. The primary author created a draft of the guidelines and then sought input from users on Twitter via a publicly accessible Google Document. There was no limitation on who could provide input and the work was done in a democratic, collaborative fashion. Contributors edited the draft over a period of 1 week (September 12-18, 2020). The primary and secondary authors then revised the draft to make it more concise. The guidelines and manuscript were then distributed to the contributors for edits and adopted by the group. All contributors were given the opportunity to serve as coauthors on the publication and were told upfront that authorship would depend on whether they were able to document the ways in which they met the 4 International Committee of Medical Journal Editors authorship criteria. Results: We developed 2 sets of guidelines: Guidelines for Listing All Social Media Scholarship Under Public Scholarship (in Research/Scholarship Section of CV) and Guidelines for Listing Social Media Scholarship Under Research, Teaching, and Service Sections of CV. Institutions can choose which set fits their existing CV format. Conclusions: With more uniformity, scholars can better represent the full scope and impact of their work. These guidelines are not intended to dictate how individual institutions should weigh social media contributions within promotion and tenure cases. Instead, by providing an initial set of guidelines, we hope to provide scholars and their institutions with a common format and language to document social media scholarship. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

The reality is that these pilot projects hardly ever reach the intended scale to contribute significantly to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this paper, we argue that two major problems undermine efforts to achieve scale in development projects. First, pilot projects are usually set up and managed in very controlled environments that make it very difficult to transition to the real world at scale. Second, poor conceptual and methodological clarity on what scaling is and how it can be pursued often results in a narrow focus on reaching numbers. Counting household adoption at the end of a grant project is a poor metric of whether these people can and will sustain adoption after the project closes, let alone if adoption will reach others and actually contributes to improved livelihoods. We advocate for a broader view on scaling that more accurately reflects the transformational change agenda of the SDGs: from reaching many to a process aiming to achieve sustainable systems change at scale. Sustainable systems change alters a sufficient number of key drivers (incentives, rules, etc.) such that the system that once perpetuated a “problem” now instead perpetuates a “solution.” This has implications on the way projects are designed and implemented. Rather than focusing on changing conditions within the project context, projects should serve as vehicles for societal change. This means that projects make most sense if designed as part of a multisector, long-term programmatic approach. Treating scaling as a transformation process helps deal with the necessary coevolution of organizational and institutional arrangements, along with the innovations in a technology or practice. To help address scaling, we present a number of frameworks that guide users to assess the scalability of innovations, design for scale from the onset of projects, and systematically think through key elements, ingredients, or success factors. We conclude that scaling requires different skills, approaches, and ways of collaborating than those required for successful implementation of pilot projects. It calls for development actors to have a mindset that allows them to creatively navigate multiple overlapping systems; likewise, they must develop a clear vision about which elements in the system the actors can and cannot address, and about where they need to collaborate strategically to exert influence. Although it is tempting to hope for the silver bullet solution that changes the world, we argue for an approach that takes scaling serious in its own right and recognizes the complexities involved in facilitating a transition to a new “normal.” © 2019","Adoption; Innovation; Scaling; Sustainability; Systems change","adoption behavior; design; incentive; innovation; long-term change; perception; sustainable development","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067304514"

At the same time, the type of SaaS company is determined to a large extent by its “average client”. This is the topic used in many empirical rules of SaaS metrics. We proposed a hypothesis about the possibility of applying game theory to improve the efficiency of customer interaction with SaaS companies, based on a model that takes into account the mutual influence and interaction of the business owner, developers and customers. The development of innovative IT products should be carried out with the fullest satisfaction of the interests and needs of all key stakeholders.

A social network analysis was performed on bibliometric data using co-inventorship on patents as an indicator of collaboration between different organisations, with a focus on the spatial and sectoral contexts. Network metrics and innovation system indices are used to describe knowledge development and exchange. The results show that university, healthcare and industry organisations have primarily been responsible for increased patenting over time. The key actors were a set of industry actors - a national actor and its US partner - who have patented many devices jointly. National universities were found to make a small contribution, and science councils were found to be absent, despite the efforts in the changing innovation landscape to encourage publicly financed research organisations to protect their intellectual property. The collaboration networks were found to be sparse and disjointed, with many actors - largely from the private healthcare sector - patenting in isolation. Significance: • The considerable number of patents filed by private sector clinicians in orthopaedic device innovation in their personal capacity is highlighted. • Few patents emanate from national universities, and science council actors are largely absent, despite the Intellectual Property Rights from Publicly Financed Research and Development Act to protect intellectual property emanating from public research organisations. • Patenting networks are more fragmented than are scientific publication networks. © 2021 Academy of Science of South Africa.

In an environment where collaboration is necessary for scientific and technological innovation, it is nonetheless challenging to identify and establish relationships between international partners, especially in emerging technological fields where no country has yet demonstrated a clear advantage. This article describes a model to facilitate a quantitative assessment and ranking of national innovation potential based on the integration of established measures (e.g., patents and peer-reviewed publication counts) as well as nonobvious or subjective measures (e.g., national attitudes toward particular veins of research) to predict future performance. Such an assessment can provide a helpful step toward improving projections of scientific performance, particularly for those countries with a relatively limited footprint in the scientific landscape.

Last decades’ research has immensely focussed on river basin water quality (WQ) prediction, risk assessment and pollutant classification techniques to design more potent management policies and advanced early warning system. The next challenge is dealing with water-related data as they are problematic to handle owing to their nonlinearity, nonstationary feature and vague properties due to the unpredictable natural changes, interdependent relationship, human interference and complexity. Artificial intelligence (AI) models have shown remarkable success and superiority to handle such data owing to their higher accuracy to deal with non-linear data, robustness, reliability, cost-effectiveness, problem-solving capability, decision-making capability, efficiency and effectiveness. AI models are the perfect tools for river WQ monitoring, management, sustainability and policymaking. This research reports the state of the art of various AI models implemented for river WQ simulation over the past two decades (2000–2020). Correspondingly, over 200 research articles are reviewed from the Web of Science journals. The survey covers the model structure, input variability, performance metrics, regional generalisation investigation and comprehensive assessments of AI models progress in river water quality research. The increasing contaminants, the lack of funding and the deficiency in data, numerous variables and unique data time series pattern based on the geological area have increased the need for river WQ monitoring and control even more. Hence, this is highly emphasising the involvement of AI models development which can deal with missing data, able to integrate the features of a black-box model and white-box models, benchmarked model and automated early warning system are few of many points need more research. Despite extensive research on WQ simulation using AI models, shortcomings remain according to the current survey, and several possible future research directions are proposed. Overall, this survey provides a new milestone in water resource engineering on the AI model implementation, innovation and transformation in surface WQ modelling with many formidable problems in different blossoming area and objectives to be achieved in the future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Hybrid model; Literature assessment and evaluation; River water quality; State of the art","Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Problem solving; Quality control; Risk assessment; Rivers; Surveys; Water quality; Anthropogenic activity; Classification technique; Comprehensive assessment; Hybrid model; Literature assessment and evaluation; Monitoring and control; River water quality; State of the art; artificial intelligence; early warning system; innovation; river basin; river engineering; river water; sustainability; water management; water quality; River pollution","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080922176"

Cloud-based data centers provide high performance computing power to analyze voluminous IoT data to provide invaluable insights to support decision making. However, multifarious servers in data centers appear to be the black hole of superfluous energy consumption that contributes to 23% of the global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in ICT (Information and Communication Technology) industry. IoT-related energy research focuses on low-power sensors and enhanced machine-to-machine communication performance. To date, cloud-based data centers still face energy-related challenges which are detrimental to the environment. Virtual machine (VM) consolidation is a well-known approach to affect energy-efficient cloud infrastructures. Although several research works demonstrate positive results for VM consolidation in simulated environments, there is a gap for investigations on real, physical cloud infrastructure for big data workloads. This research work addresses the gap of conducting real physical cloud infrastructure-based experiments. The primary goal of setting up a real physical cloud infrastructure is for the evaluation of dynamic VM consolidation approaches which include integrated algorithms from existing relevant research. An open source VM consolidation framework, Openstack NEAT is adopted and experiments are conducted on a Multi-node Openstack Cloud with Apache Spark as the big data platform. Open sourced Openstack has been deployed because it enables rapid innovation, and boosts scalability as well as resource utilization. Additionally, this research work investigates the performance based on service level agreement (SLA) metrics and energy usage of compute hosts. Relevant results concerning the best performing combination of algorithms are presented and discussed. © 2020 by the authors.

Fall rate is a key quality metric of acute care hospitals, rehabilitation settings, and long-term care facilities. Fall prevention policies with proper implementation have been the focus of surveys by regulatory bodies, including The Joint Commission and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, for all healthcare settings. Since October 2008, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has stopped reimbursing hospitals for the costs related to patient falls, shifting the accountability for fall prevention to the healthcare providers. Research shows that almost one-third of falls can be prevented and extensive fall prevention interventions exist. Recently, technology-based applications have been introduced in healthcare to obtain superior patient care outcomes and experience via efficiency, access, and reliability. Several areas in fall prevention deploy technology, including predictive and prescriptive analytics using big data, video monitoring and alarm technology, wearable sensors, exergame and virtual reality, robotics in home environment assessment, and personal coaching.

This was the third of three surveys conducted by the researchers since 2011. Ten key insights were formulated to gauge the progress of innovation in organizations as well as the practice and success of nine innovation methods (data analytics, design thinking, innovation metrics, etc.) used to support innovation execution. Design/methodology/approach: The survey data was bifurcated into two groups, high and low innovators, by analyzing their innovation scores using a K-means cluster analysis. This was followed by correlational analysis with the innovation practices by these groups. Qualitative survey data was also collected and used to interpret the results. Findings: Overall innovation scores have improved over the decade. Organizations are still struggling with process drivers such as idea management and innovation measures. High innovators are pervasively using innovative methods to advance innovation execution much more than low innovators. The two methods that showed the highest correlation to an innovative culture were design thinking and open innovation. Originality/value: Comparing the Global Innovation Survey to two other surveys, 2011 Canadian Executives (n = 605) and 2013 US Fortune 1000 (n = 1,203) that use the same innovation measurement scale, provides a unique longitudinal perspective. The nine innovation methods investigated in the Global Innovation Survey provide original insight into how high and low innovative organizations are using methods to advance innovation execution. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Culture; Innovation; Innovation score; Measurement; Methods; Survey","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079146190"

Design/methodology/approach: A joint analysis of behavioral and objective performance data from globalized manufacturing links perceptual customer metrics that relate to dimensions of relationship quality (i.e. attitudinal loyalty, perceived customer orientation, customers’ perceived innovativeness of the supplier and perceived customer influence on supplier innovation) with behavioral outcomes (i.e. share of wallet (SOW) and customer account profitability). Using data from a global business-to-business (B2B) customer survey together with archival performance data from a multinational mechanical engineering firm, a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) is performed. Findings: The fsQCA results suggest that perceptual customer metrics related to innovation can be relevant aspects of relationship quality, in line with Anderson and Mittal’s (2000) satisfaction-repurchase-profitability chain framework and its adaptation to SOW. However, the underlying complexities in the different combinations of attributes in the recipe are such that they are not equifinal in leading to higher SOW or higher profitability. This paper finds indications for non-linearities between perceptual measures investigated and profitability of customer accounts, with particular relevance for the role of perceived customer orientation, perceived product innovativeness of the supplier and attitudinal loyalty. Research limitations/implications: The analysis faces a number of limitations, starting with its reliance on cross-sectional survey data, which does not enable us to account for feedback mechanisms, for example, arising from customer perceptions regarding innovation aspects. The lack of a multidimensional conceptionalization of the perceptual customer constructs may have limited the analysis, considering also recent evidence from retail companies in the furniture sector in Spain, suggesting that the multidimensional conceptualization of relationship value explained satisfaction and loyalty levels to a greater extent than the one-dimensional conceptualization (Ruiz-Martínez et al., 2019). Practical implications: In terms of managerial implication, the results suggest that customers perceive limited value in participating in the focal firm’s innovation value chain funnel, hence customer loyalty cannot be bought using simple incentive strategies. The results with regard to customer account profitability suggest that B2B customers investigated here may distinguish when interacting with their globalized supplier in the innovation funnel: they may see a positive customer value when the innovation is a product, and thus, relation-specific, whereas they may see limited customer value when innovation is considered in more generic terms (customers’ perceived influence on supplier innovation in general). Originality/value: This paper starts from the premise that perceptual customer metrics can matter for supplier performance, as the customer relationship and customer value management research has shown. However, there is limited empirical evidence from globalized manufacturing sectors incorporating perceptual constructs in behavioral outcomes, and limited evidence assessing customer-perceived value in such sectors through alternate approaches to main-effects focused analyzes. We employ qualitative comparative analysis using fuzzy sets (Russo et al., 2019) to address these gaps, focusing on two key behavioral outcomes, namely, customer account profitability and SOW. © 2020, Bodo Steiner and Moritz Brandhoff.","B2B customer value; Customer catisfaction; fsQCA; Global business; Innovation; Loyalty; Manufacturing industries; Mechanical engineering; Perceptual customer constructs; Share of wallet","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098057857"

Methods: ""Innovation activity""was defined as the number of drugs for which R&D activities have been reported within the last three years. Such activities were measured by collecting the data on drug developments and classifying them by developer company, phase of development, therapeutic use, and the country in which the development conducted. Subsequently, we examined and compared the correlations between the global innovation activities of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies and the disease burden measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) by income level and region. In addition, this study analyzed the association between country-specific innovations and DALYs in the corresponding countries. Results: At a global level, the innovation activities were not associated with global DALYs. However, when analyzed by income level, the innovation activities were associated with DALYs in high income and upper middle income countries while it was not associated with DALYs in low middle income and low income countries. In terms of region, correlations were found between the innovation activities and DALYs in the European region, the Americas, and the Western Pacific region whereas such correlations were not found in the African, Eastern Mediterranean, and South-East Asian regions. Similar to the analyses by income level and region, correlations between country-specific innovations and DALYs were only found in high income or high GDP countries. In addition, an empirical analysis of several cases including Canada, Germany, South Korea, and the United Kingdom revealed that pharmaceutical innovation is more closely related to market size than disease burden. Conclusions: This study identified that discrepancies between pharmaceutical innovation and public health needs, i.e., disease burden values, have persisted until recently. To alleviate this imbalance, both public and private sectors should not only fulfill their respective roles and responsibilities regarding these issues, but also make strategic and collaborative efforts such as Product Development Partnerships (PDPs) directed toward public health improvement. © 2020 The Author(s).","Disease burden; Innovation activities; Multinational pharmaceutical companies; Pharmaceutical innovation; Public-private partnerships","Benchmarking; Cost of Illness; Disabled Persons; Drug Industry; Female; Global Health; Humans; Income; Life Expectancy; Male; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Africa; Canada; Germany; Mediterranean Region; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (West); South America; South Korea; Southeast Asia; United Kingdom; drug; comparative study; disease; drug development; innovation; multinational enterprise; pharmaceutical industry; product development; public health; public-private partnership; research and development; Article; Canada; comparative study; disability-adjusted life year; disease burden; drug industry; Germany; health care need; high income country; middle income country; priority journal; public health; public-private partnership; South Korea; United Kingdom; Western Hemisphere; benchmarking; cost of illness; disabled person; female; global health; human; income; life expectancy; male; quality adjusted life year","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090818255"

However, this goal is difficult to achieve by using the traditional landscape metric based on the Patch-Mosaic Model (PMM), as they don’t integrate ecological processes with landscape patterns. In this paper, we proposed a conceptual model, i.e., the Source-Pathway-Sink Model (SPSM), which designates the role of a landscape unit into “source”, “sink”, or “pathway” based on specific ecological processes during the landscape pattern analysis. While the traditional landscape metrics derived from the PMM model is visual- or geometrical-oriented and lack of linkage to ecological significance, the SPSM model is process-oriented, dynamic, and scale dependent. A comparison between the PMM and the SPSM models shows that the SPSM model is complementary to the PMM model, and can provide a simple and dynamic perspective on landscape pattern analysis. The SPSM model may represent a conceptual innovation in landscape ecology. © 2019, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Ecological significance; Landscape metric; Landscape pattern analysis; Patch-Mosaic Model (PMM); Process-oriented; Source-Pathway-Sink Model (SPSM)","Earth sciences; Natural sciences; Ecological significance; Landscape metric; Landscape pattern analysis; Patch-Mosaic Model (PMM); Process-oriented; Source-Pathway-Sink Model (SPSM); comparative study; conceptual framework; ecological impact; ecological theory; innovation; numerical model; Ecology","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073946493"

Vast spaces and the presence of the richest natural resources pose major challenges for Russia associated with the task of their rational development and use of the spatial and logistic potential of the Arctic macroregion. It is obvious that in the conditions of the rapid development of technologies that are transforming the world economy, the competitive development of the Arctic without a new industrialization of industry is not possible. A state policy capable of giving an adequate response to great challenges is only being formed, which actualizes the task of methodological support of the mechanisms for forming a strategy for the new industrialization of the Arctic economy. The article discusses the problems and mechanisms of sustainable economic development of the Russian Arctic, based on the concept of a new industrialization of the Arctic economy. For the formation of an economy of an innovative type, the implementation of entrepreneurial and scientific and technological potential, an effective innovation ecosystem is required. For this, it is proposed to create a world-class scientific and educational center in the Arctic macroregion. Providing a competitive model for the industrial development of the Arctic economy also involves the development of a system of indicators that adequately reflect the level of structural stability of the innovative development of the industrial complex. The quality metric of such stability, in our opinion, can be a modified Herfindahl-Hirschman index, adapted to the problem being solved. © 2021 Journal Office of Chinese School Health(Bengbu)","converged network model; innovation; regional innovation ecosystem; reindustrialization; sustainable economic development; triple helix model","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151859307"

It focuses on the longitudinal examination of SC research in terms of subject area concentration, and countries, contributions towards SC research and the key sources of SC research. The study also attempts to investigate the efforts made by construction management researchers towards the exploration and application of SC in construction management processes. A comprehensive bibliometric search of SC documents generated a search result of 1,002 publications. A total of 182 publications were examined since only peer-reviewed journal papers were considered for this review study. 2018 recorded the highest number of publications (over 400% increase of the previous year, 2017). China, the U.S., and the U.K. have been the leading countries contributing immensely towards SC research. Despite the tremendous efforts over the past decade of SC research, the results show a significant lack of interdisciplinary collaborations among researchers. Moreover, a huge gap of SC research in construction/project management-related domains was identified, revealing the need for critical explorations on SC research and the applicability of SC during the planning, procuring, executing, and managing construction project-related processes. This study is, therefore, intended to incite a deeper engagement in SC research from construction management (CM) researchers, identifying the benefits and challenges of the application of SC systems in CM processes. Thus, contributing to a deepened understanding of SC in CM. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Blockchain Technology; Construction Management; Innovation; Smart Contracts","Publishing; Area concentrations; Computer science and engineerings; Construction innovation; Construction management; Construction management process; Construction projects; Future applications; Interdisciplinary collaborations; Project management","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096811482"

This shift is a necessary recognition that protected areas alone will be insufficient to conserve a large proportion of species globally, especially given competing pressures for land development and marine resources. However, despite clear demonstrations of the potential benefits of managing terrestrial and marine resources to produce a sustainable mix of environmental and human co-benefits, many of the most promising models remain under-funded or largely aspirational. Consequently, only 12–17% of the estimated $300–$400 billion* of investment needed annually to maintain healthy ecosystems globally currently flows to conservation finance, with most originating from limited public and philanthropic sources. Those numbers contrast with the amount of capital available to invest globally. Institutional investors and other asset managers have more than $175 trillion in assets under management that are being invested in economic activity globally. Many of these investors are increasingly demanding that environmental sustainability be used, at least partly, to guide investment decisions. As a result of this growing demand, sustainable investment funds in the United States grew by over 33% from 2014 to 2016 and now comprise about one-fifth ($9 trillion) of professionally managed assets. Substantial opportunities may, therefore, exist to direct private capital towards conservation investments, despite the marketplace for such investments being slow to develop to date. The promise of conservation investing notwithstanding, there remain important barriers and concerns about unintended or negative outcomes for people and the planet due to bad actors, redirection of public resources, perverse incentives, misaligned objectives, or poorly designed projects. In this issue, we summarize specific challenges and opportunities related to the mobilization of private capital in conservation. There is a critically important role for the development of consistent and accountable frameworks to guide project design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation while also ensuring equitable and beneficial outcomes for all stakeholders. Scientists and practitioners in the social and ecological sciences, as well as law and finance fields, can shape these rapidly growing initiatives by helping to: 1. Design investable projects with meaningful conservation impacts. 2. Develop rigorous but flexible frameworks to standardize metrics and monitoring protocols, compare project and investment outcomes, and track progress towards global targets. 3. Establish safeguards, protocols, and ethics for engaging local stakeholders. 4. Create blueprints to facilitate the design of projects that allow investors to generate economic returns while ensuring positive, sustainable outcomes for the environment. 5.

Then the impacts of industrial electricity price on these metrics were investigated. The results showed that the increase in industrial electricity price would not inhibit development of enterprises by increasing energy costs, but would promote improvement of GTFP, which proved that the “low-electricity price trap” did exist. The higher the level of the industrial electricity price, the stronger the promotion effect. Additionally, these effects showed region heterogeneities, and they were observed highest in the east and lowest in the west. The mechanism analysis showed that although enhancing in industrial electricity price increased the energy cost of enterprises, it could force the enterprises to carry out technological innovation, improve technical efficiency, and ultimately improve GTFP.

Use of this emergent technology allowed the evaluation of vocalization distribution, turn taking frequency and overlapping speech metrics. Main results of the analysis showed that team vocalization tenure corresponds to performance results but vocalization distribution does not, which was unexpected. We found where the average speech segment was high, the meeting overcome the 100% of team vocalization tenure, and the total overlap time was also high. We identified different kinds of overlapping speech. Higher overlapping seems to occur more frequently when total overlap time is high but dominance is low than when total overlap and dominance are both high.

To measure the innovations brought by Circular Economy, there is a recent need to develop circularity indicators, mainly for micro level (companies and products). Furthermore, the complexity of Circular Economy implies in a set of multi-dimensional indicators instead of a single one. This paper aims to develop a set of indicators linking Circular Economy principles, Circular Business Model and the pillars of Sustainability. The set of indicators was developed based in the hypothetic-deductive approach, following a number of iterations (cycles) and testing the theory in the empirical world. A mix of research methods (e.g. expert consulting, user's feedback, and case studies) was applied. The proposed indicators should be able to achieve the principles of the Circular Economy, and, at the same time, help to meet the specificities and needs of each circular business model. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a group of indicators, focused in the three dimensions of Sustainability (environmental (from material perspective), economic and social), applied in Circular Business Models to capture the innovations brought by Circular Economy that conventional indicators do not measure. Moreover, they will help any company to identify areas with high importance and potential for improvement, and thus increase Circular Economy performance in an efficient, clear and prompt manner. These indicators were applied in three Brazilian companies which have three different Circular Business Models. The results show that data from economic and social dimensions was not available or was diffused in the companies. It represents a barrier because most of the positive impacts gained with Circular Economy are presented in the social dimension, including job creation, mindset change, etc. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Circular business model; Circular economy; Indicators; Metrics; Sustainability","Indicators (instruments); Industrial engineering; Production engineering; Brazilian companies; Business modeling; Circular economy; Metrics; Multi dimensional; Number of iterations; Social dimensions; Sustainable operations; Sustainable development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075451055"

Spatial pattern analysis was built on this foundation of interdisciplinarity, and these connections continue to foster new trajectories in the field. Objectives: Using the Isserman Curve (i.e., the innovation-adoption or cumulative knowledge curve) as a framing device, this paper examines how interdisciplinary perspectives continue to help de-lock from periods of incremental improvement in spatial pattern analysis and launch new, transformative directions for describing and analyzing spatial patterns. Results: Examples of interdisciplinary perspectives from three fields are discussed alongside the promising trajectories being launched. These include: (1) microscopy and surface metrology, which are contributing methods for analyzing spatial patterns in gradient surfaces, (2) thermodynamics and information theory, which contribute a foundation for measuring entropy and an understanding of how landscape patterns are governed by the central organizing principles of nature, and (3) regional studies, which utilizes alternative conceptualizations of proximity that may be applied to graph-based approaches to better incorporate functional connectivity. Conclusions: Landscape ecology’s interdisciplinary roots have been instrumental for developing innovative approaches to spatial pattern analysis, and outside perspectives continue to add richly to development efforts today. During periods of incremental improvement, landscape ecologists have drawn from other disciplines to create new seedbeds for ideas.

Design/methodology/approach: This research provides a review and synthesis of transdisciplinary literatures to establish a basis for the conceptual framework proposed for SIS. Findings: It is argued that the primary unit of an SIS is the service firm and that there are micro-, meso-, and macro-level actors and enablers in the ecosystem that can help bring about SIS. Examples from the hospitality and tourism industry are used to demonstrate key points. Practical implications: Benefits of an SIS to companies include growth through new markets and innovative value offerings, sustainable supply chains in production, building consumer value and trust in the company/brand, attracting and retaining talent and being proactive in including social and environmental measures of success in customer metrics and company financial reporting. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the social innovation and service literature by: offering a new, scientifically supported view of an SIS; providing managers with a framework to guide social innovation within their service firm and for the benefit of their company and its stakeholders; and directing service scholars to research issues necessary to advance SIS. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Hospitality; Metrics; Social innovation; Sustainability; Tourism","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067835411"

The academic researchers often lack motivation to seek entrepreneurial opportunities for their GCIs. They are often discouraged after considering the burden required to convince private investors to finance their GCIs beyond technology readiness level 4. Further, many academic institutions lack a structured framework to bridge the divide between a basic research and viable product. Here we propose a four-pronged approach for developing sustainability performance metrics that can be used by early investors to understand the commercialization prospects of the GCIs: (1) conduct a screening-level LCA of the GCI and simultaneously reduce uncertainties of underlying data and technological readiness; (2) compare the LCA performance of the GCI with similar commercial products in the target market; (3) factor the LCA results into investment evaluation methods; and (4) transform LCA results into indicators that reflect sustainability performance of the innovation. Finally, we present a case study that highlights the use of this approach for developing commercial opportunities for the emerging graphene-composites as corrosion resistant coatings for civil infrastructure applications.

Despite considerable effort made in developing drugs, pharmaceutical firms experience declines in novelty for drugs they produced. As AI becomes an important general purpose technology (GPT), it could be used to address some known challenges in the drug development process. Using two large-scale datasets that contain detailed historical records of global drug development and patents, we identify AI-related patents to approximate firms' AI capabilities and construct a relatively new similarity-based metric to measure drug novelty based on their chemical structure. We find that AI can primarily affect the earliest stage in drug discovery when tasks are heavily dependent on automatic data processing and reasoning. However, it may not necessarily help with the more expensive and risky clinical trial stages that require substantial human engagements and interventions. Additionally, AI can facilitate the development for drugs at the medium level of chemical novelty more than at the extreme ends of the spectrum. Our study sheds light on the understanding of the roles and limitations modern technology can have on drug development, one of the most complex innovation processes in the world. © 40th International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2019.

The paper reviews the problem of anomaly detection in home automation systems. Authors define specificities of the existing security networks and accentuate the need of the detection of informational and physical impact on sensors. Characteristics of the transmitted information and physical impacts on automation devices are analysed and used as metrics for the anomalous behavior detection. Various machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection are compared and reviewed. Methods. The paper reviews the anomaly detection method that includes artificial neural networks as a detection tool. In this method characteristics of the security network devices are analysed to detect an anomalous behaviour, and exactly this type of data should be used to train the artificial neural network. This paper describes tools that can be used to implement the offered anomaly detection method. Main results. As an experiment the scenario has been created so that the model of the 'Smart home' system produces the data of network information streams and the artificial neural network decides from this data. As a result the training and testing sets has been produced. The configuration of the artificial neural network has been defined as a result of tests. The experiment shows the potential of described method due to the fact that the area under ROC curve is 0.9689, which is better than basic machine learning algorithms performance. Practical importance. The offered method can be used at the development stage while implementation of the information and security systems requiring monitoring of the connected devices. Anomaly detection technology excludes the possibility of the inconspicuous violation of the information's confidentiality and integrity. © 2017 FRUCT.","","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Home networks; Innovation; Intelligent buildings; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; Wireless sensor networks; Anomalous behavior; Anomaly detection methods; Area under roc curve (AUC); Development stages; Home automation systems; Network information; Practical importance; Training and testing; Network security","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85037808437"

A new Teaching Excellent Framework (TEF) emerged in 2017 with results determined primarily by proxy data of National Student Survey (NSS) scores, retention data and Longitudinal Educational Outcomes data (LEO). The TEF has been rapidly repurposed in order to shape the behaviour and priorities of both students and academics. The discourse of the TEF legislation, bolstered by studies from HEA/HEPI, assumes the source of inequality of outcome is poor teaching requiring corrective action by universities. Further justification for surveillance and quasi-regulation is borne by appeals to ‘value for money’ and ‘competition’. I argue that what seems to be an arbitrary constellation of proxy data points has in fact been a calculated plan to render universities, staff and students as neoliberal subjects. The accident of accessibility, inasmuch as it overlaps with the neoliberal imperative, has determined which data shall function as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and the whole assemblage is cemented by discursive choices which align with neoliberal principles.

Although the topic has been widely discussed, the validation of the concept of proximity vis-à-vis CBIC has been persistently hindered by a lack of readily available empirical metrics. Therefore, this research note attempts to operationalize the varying types of proximity–in relation to CBIC–in the form of a questionnaire tested through pilot studies of two CBRs, at the Finnish–Swedish and Danish–German border, and for two contrasting service industries, namely knowledge-intensive business services and tourism. The findings indicate that the developed survey metrics are effective in depicting the phenomenon of proximity.

Here, we provide an overview of the state of the art in using TLS for estimating forest structure for AGB. We provide a general overview of TLS methods and then outline the advantages and limitations of TLS for estimating AGB. We discuss the specific type of measurements that TLS can provide, tools and methods that have been developed for turning TLS point clouds into quantifiable metrics of tree size and volume, as well as some of the challenges to improving these measurements. We discuss the role of TLS for enabling accurate calibration and validation (cal/val) of Earth observation (EO)-derived estimates of AGB from spaceborne lidar and RADAR missions. We give examples of the types of TLS equipment that are in use and how these might develop in future, and we show examples of where TLS has already been applied to measuring AGB in the tropics in particular. Comparing TLS with harvested AGB shows r2 > 0.95 for all studies thus far, with absolute agreement to within 10% at the individual tree level for all trees and to within 2% in the majority of cases. Current limitations to the uptake of TLS include the capital cost of some TLS equipment, processing complexity and the relatively small coverage that is possible. We argue that combining TLS measurements with the existing ground-based survey approaches will allow improved allometric models and better cal/val, resulting in improved regional and global estimates of AGB from space, with better-characterised, lower uncertainties. The development of new, improved equipment and methods will accelerate this process and make TLS more accessible. © 2019, The Author(s).","3D forest structure; Above-ground biomass; Biomass; Forest structure; Terrestrial lidar","Biomass; Forestry; Laser applications; Optical radar; Seebeck effect; Steel beams and girders; Uncertainty analysis; Above ground biomass; Airborne technology; Calibration and validations; Forest canopy structure; Forest structure; Processing complexity; Terrestrial laser scanning; Terrestrial lidars; aboveground biomass; canopy architecture; innovation; lidar; terrestrial ecosystem; three-dimensional modeling; Surveying instruments","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061399341"

While dematerialization and the circular economy (CE) have both been proposed to mitigate increasing material consumption, recent research has shown that these methods may be ineffective at achieving net material use reduction: When focused on specific products, these methods neglect the effects of complex interactions among and increasing consumption of consumer electronic products. The research presented here develops and applies a material flow analysis aimed at evaluating an entire “product ecosystem,” thereby including the effects of increasing consumption, product trade-offs, and technological innovations. Results are then used to evaluate the potential efficacy of “natural” dematerialization (occurring as technology advances or smaller products substitute for larger ones) and CE (closing the loop between secondary material supply and primary material demand). Results show that material consumption by the ecosystem of electronics commonly used by U.S. households peaked in 2000. This consumption relies on increasingly diverse materials, including gold, cobalt, and indium, for whom secondary supply is still negligible, particularly given low recovery rates, often less than 1%. Potential circularity metrics of material “dilution,” “dispersion,” and “demand mismatch” are also evaluated, and indicate that CE approaches aimed at closing the loop on consumer electronic material still face several critical barriers particularly related to design and efficient recycling infrastructure. © 2018 by Yale University","circular economy; community ecology; dematerialization; electronics; material flow analysis; product ecosystem","United States; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Electronic equipment; Secondary recovery; Circular economy; Community ecology; Dematerialization; Material flow analysis; Product ecosystems; community ecology; economic conditions; electronic equipment; environmental economics; innovation; material flow analysis; recycling; strategic approach; technological change; technological development; technology adoption; trade-off; Dispersions","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046815287"

The survey was conducted with the Q-TIP platform, which we designed for the study and is now open to all researchers (https://qtip.geography.wisc.edu/). Our study asked how stream restoration should be evaluated in state regulatory programs. Streams are dynamic and multi-scalar geomorphological, chemical, biological, as well as socio-cultural systems and it is not obvious what good restoration means or how it should be assessed. Across the stream restoration community we found four different priorities, each of which differently characterizes the feasibility of assessing outcomes. These four perspectives were that metrics of success should: (a) be rigorous and site-focused; (b) be simple and easy to implement in the field; (c) capture complexity; (d) reflect innovations in watershed planning, ecosystem functions, and stakeholder inclusion. These subject-positions on assessment do not, however, map cleanly onto informant profession or background, and a single informant can hold more than one view. Despite relatively limited uptake in geography, Q offers the promise of a critical quantitative approach to researching subjectivity in a way that is compatible with poststructural understandings of identity. We use our case material to show that methodological rules of thumb limit Q's potential, but we demonstrate unconventional approaches. Drawing on the process and results of our survey of stream restoration practitioners, we argue that Q-method can help in the task of representing subjectivity while respecting its complexity. © 2019","Environmental governance; Metrics; Q method; Stream restoration; Subjectivity","United States; complexity; environmental management; environmental restoration; governance approach; performance assessment; planning method; regulatory framework; stream","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068257727"

Accepting Hjorth’s critique that managerialism aims at producing ‘today’s ideal of self-managing enterprising employees’, the pressing issue is to understand how organisation, when re-configured around budgets, targets and other metrics, can be opened up to passion, carnival and play without augmenting the ‘power of place’. Asking how ‘spaces of play’ get foreclosed by the ‘ecological press’ of creativity being turned towards money-making, particular scrutiny is given to the ways in which ‘institutional logics’ get altered by internalising money-orientations. Three paradigm cases of reverse-thinking in innovation are examined: namely, Edison’s supply of electricity, Sloan’s use of ROI to grant autonomy, and JIT’s lead towards the flexible factory. While suggestive of the role money may play in limiting creativity to the possible and the potential, the analysis shows how change towards the virtual can be triggered by complex modes of reverse-thinking. While the analysis challenges ‘market logics’ that put creativity in the hands of the ‘chance and caprice’ of internal competition, I conclude that negative effects on the ecological press of creativity, such as ‘making play pay’, might be better countered by more research over how money’s presence and absence is created and tempered. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","ecological press; innovation; institutional logics; metrics; money-orientation (M-C-M); power of place; reverse-thinking; spaces of play; the virtual","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041931218"

Supervised machine learning approaches rely on a training dataset, a relatively small set of documents with human-annotated labels indicating their topic, to build models that automatically classify a larger set of unclassified documents. “Active” machine learning has been proposed as an approach that limits the cost of creating a training dataset by interactively and sequentially focussing on training only the most informative documents. We simulate active learning using a dataset of approximately 7000 abstracts from the scientific literature related to the chemical arsenic. The dataset was previously annotated by subject matter experts with regard to relevance to two topics relating to toxicology and risk assessment. We examine the performance of alternative sampling approaches to sequentially expanding the training dataset, specifically looking at uncertainty-based sampling and probability-based sampling. We discover that while such active learning methods can potentially reduce training dataset size compared to random sampling, predictions of model performance in active learning are likely to suffer from statistical bias that negates the method’s potential benefits. We discuss approaches and the extent to which the bias resulting from skewed sampling can be compensated. We propose a useful role for active learning in contexts in which the accuracy of model performance metrics is not critical and/or where it is beneficial to rapidly create a class-balanced training dataset. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Active learning; Automated document classification; Literature review; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Systematic review","classification; exploration; health risk; innovation; literature review; numerical model; performance assessment; prediction; risk assessment; supervised learning","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060231465"

The first part analyzes programmatic variables of projects developed through CIF that may serve as indicators of the projects receiving additional, non-CIF funds for continued work, as continued funding is one measure of success. This analysis follows a similar investigation conducted in 2016 of the same program, but with a 30% larger data set due to two more years of data collection. These results focus on collaborations and additional years of funding as key variables for projects continuing through other funding sources. The second part develops new, comprehensive measures of success and innovation for projects, conducts a pilot of applying the metrics to two years of projects, and analyzes the results. These results focus on improving the measures to enable analysis of the CIF portfolio in the future. The goal of this overall effort is to inform changes to CIF program policy to improve the success and innovation of its portfolio. The primary goal of the distribution of the results is to inform members of other technology organizations who may be considering a similar data-driven approach to policy development.

How will machine learning and AI change this? Building off previous work quantifying historical computational power levels, the paper explores the relationship of metrics for computing power with US GDP and US internet sector GDP from 1960 to today. The paper develops forecast scenarios incorporating machine learning development using internet data production volumes and forecasted growth of computational power. The goal of the research is not to build a full model of productivity that incorporates computational power, but to begin to get a sense of potential role and impacts of artificial intelligence on the economy. The research has three main findings. First, the paper finds a modest but statistically significant relationship between computational power and economic productivity, linked to approximately 0.3-0.7 percent of GDP per capita and to approximately 2-3 percent of internet sector GDP per capita. Second, and as expected, the relationship is stronger for internet sector GDP per capita, which is linked more closely to AI. Third, and as expected, when the paper narrows its window of analysis to more recent windows of analysis in the regressions and in robustness tests, it sees a strengthening of the relationship between computational power and GDP per capita. © Common Ground Research Networks, Christopher Hooton, Davin Kaing, All Rights Reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Innovation; Productivity","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057005181"

Provided the difficulty associated with assessing the outputs and outcomes of technology platforms, this work proposes a practical assessment method based on the retrieval and analysis of online documents related to the technology platforms. Concretely, the method consists of applying web scraping techniques to retrieve documents related to a technology platform from the Internet and then applying web data-mining techniques to automatically classify these documents into the functions that the platform should fulfill, which are described from the viewpoint of co-evolution of innovation. Data are automatically processed to obtain a variety of metrics, which are applied to measure the impact of European Technology Platforms (ETPs) on promoting an organic food paradigm. This method provides time-series data that helps to follow the evolution of the different functions of the platform and to describe its lifecycle. It has been applied to one platform taken as a case study, TP Organics, which represents a key platform for stakeholders that promote organic farming and agroecology as core components of an ambitious program for sustainable agriculture. The obtained online-based measures have been proven to assess the global evolution of the platform, its dissemination through the European Union (EU) Member States, and the evolution of the different functions expected to be fulfilled by it regarding the diffusion and promotion of innovations in organic agriculture. © 2018 by the authors.","Data mining; Innovation in sustainable agriculture; Online data; Sustainable agri-food systems; Technology platforms; TP organics","agroecology; alternative agriculture; assessment method; data mining; innovation; Internet; organic farming; stakeholder; sustainability; technology; time series","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057814394"

It has recently been suggested that letting health care professionals choose the performance metrics on which they are evaluated may improve value of care by facilitating greater employee initiative, especially in the quality domain. There is a risk that this strategy leads to loss of performance as measured by the classical goals, if these goals are not prioritized by health care professionals. In this study we investigate the performance of eight hospital departments in the second largest region of Denmark that were delegated the authority to choose their own performance focus during a three-year test period from 2013 to 2016. The usual activity-based remuneration was suspended and departments were instructed to keep their global budgets and maintain activity levels, while managing according to their newly chosen performance focuses. Our analysis is based on monthly observations from two years before to three years after delegation. We collected data for 32 new performance indicators chosen by hospital department managements; 11 new performance indicators chosen by a centre management under which 5 of the departments were organised; and 3 classical indicators of priority to the central administration (activity, productivity, and cost containment). Interrupted time series analysis is used to estimate the effect of delegation on these indicators. We find no evidence that this particular proposal for giving health care professionals greater autonomy leads to consistent quality improvements but, on the other hand, also no consistent evidence of harm to the classical goals. Future studies could consider alternative possibilities to create greater autonomy for hospital departments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Delegation of authority; Denmark; Hospital governance; Innovation; Interrupted time series; Performance management; Quality management","Delivery of Health Care; Denmark; Health Personnel; Hospital Administration; Humans; Professional Autonomy; Quality Improvement; Denmark; autonomy; governance approach; health care; hospital sector; innovation; management practice; time series; budget; cost control; Denmark; hospital department; human; productivity; professional delegation; remuneration; time series analysis; total quality management; Denmark; economics; health care delivery; health care personnel; hospital management; organization and management; professional practice; total quality management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85033368472"

Numerous studies revealed that university campuses could play a substantial role in boosting the innovation within communities and reinforcing the mission of developing human resources aligned with fostering competitive technological advantages. In new cities, societies tend to maximize their competitive benefits to attract more talents and investment. Thus, reconstructing the relationship between campus and the new city is becoming more substantial for the survival and foolishness of these new communities. Therefore, this study is organized based on two premises, the first straightforward is, hypothesizing that both, urban and spatial characteristics and configurations of university campus may increase or decrease the possibilities of innovation to take place within the city. The second attribute is more holistic, assuming that there is a kind of correlation between community or campus-scale planning, and space-scale setting in fostering interaction and thriving innovation. Accordingly, the research is a trial to articulate the design framework which may control the efficiency of this relationship to promote innovation within a broad ecosystem.

Among them, the OpenStreetMap project (OSM) has been very successful in collecting/offering volunteered geographic information (VGI). Very different behaviours are observed among OSM participants, which translate into large differences of lifespan, contribution levels (e.g. Nielsen’s 90–9-1 rule) and attitudes towards innovations (e.g. Diffusion of innovation theory or DoIT). So far, the literature has defined phases in the life cycle of contributors only based on the nature of their contributions (e.g. role of participants and edits characteristics). Our study identifies the different phases of their life cycle from a temporal perspective and assesses how these phases relate to the volume and the frequency of the contributions from participants. Survival analyses were performed using both a complementary cumulative distribution function and a Kaplan-Meier estimator to plot survival and hazard curves. The analyses were broken down according to Nielsen and DoIT contributors’ categories to highlight potential explanatory variables. This paper shows that two contribution processes combine with three major participation stages to form six phases in contributors’ life cycle. The volume of edits provided on each active day is driven by the two contribution processes, illustrating the evolution of contributors’ motivation over time. Since contributors’ lifespan is a universal metric, our results may also apply to other collaborative online communities. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

We have developed a novel approach to help these students prepare for college admissions and achieve college success through intensive mentoring by STEM professionals and support through technology innovations. We developed a comprehensive, competency-based curriculum that includes academics, application preparation, essay development, financial aid, test preparation and college visits. Students complete a capstone portfolio project at the end of the summer intervention, and we continue to provide longitudinal support throughout their high school and college years. Over the past nine summers we implemented our model with an all-volunteer staff to achieve significant, measurable results: 168 students have participated in the program; 98% of surveyed program alumni are on-track to earning their four-year college degrees; and the majority plan to earn degrees in STEM and to pursue a graduate degree. Our outcomes significantly outperform both students from similar backgrounds and the overall student population. In this manuscript, we provide an overview of our model, insights into how this approach may be extended to other communities and suggestions for evaluating program efficacy in a data-driven framework. © 2018 IEEE.","College Preparation; Low-income; Mentoring; Metrics; Outreach; STEM; Underrepresented; Underserved","Education computing; Professional aspects; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); College preparations; Low incomes; Mentoring; Metrics; Outreach; Underrepresented; Underserved; Students","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048086588"

Within these formal knowledge products, there are knowledge objects that synthesize the creative process performed by authors and that could take several formats such as matrices, tables, schemes, and graphics. The researchers created those knowledge objects for several purposes such as generating, managing, supporting, reporting and interpreting knowledge and information. However, this traditional way to divulge research outputs hides knowledge objects, and presents at least, three not desired consequences: (1) an interruption of the knowledge management process;(2) the dilution of the scientific and practical potential value of the knowledge objects; and (3) the use of metrics that only consider the impact of the full publication without measuring the value of embedded knowledge objects. To handle these issues, we propose a web system based on open innovation philosophy called Prometeo, for posting knowledge objects extracted from traditional publications, to enhance the dissemination of research outputs as well as upgrade scientific productivity metrics by improving knowledge and intellectual management processes within research centers and educational institutions. We propose that knowledge objects, within extensive publications, should be linked to them and in that form will potentialize the impact of the formal publication, that of the knowledge objects posted, and eventually, that of the researcher and the research center. The web system will increase science impact by observing services such as intellectual property protection and valuation. © 2019 Academic Conferences Limited.

Thus little is known about progress and permanence following adoption. To better understand the relationship between agroforestry implementation and community development, seventy-seven practitioners in Cameroon with three or more years of experience were surveyed about the relationships between agroforestry and community development. Hypotheses were that they have observed differences in the association between agroforestry and community capitals. They were also surveyed about their satisfaction with agroforestry. Hypotheses were that satisfaction is high and negatively skewed when compared to community capitals measurements. Game play was used to collect responses. Friedman’s two-way non-parametric statistic was used to test for inter-item differences within the community capitals and satisfaction response sets. Shapiro–Wilk statistic was used to test for normality in both response sets and a bootstrap procedure and t-tests were used to test for differences in data skewness and kurtosis. Natural capital scored highest but did not differ significantly from built, human, and social capitals. Financial capital was significantly lower than natural capital, but not built, human, or social capitals. Political and cultural capitals were significantly lower compared to all others.

A few recent studies have inferred that innovations are the missing link that connects the environmental sustainability of a firm to other performance metrics; however, the evidence of such a proposition has been restricted to being conceptual or anecdotal. Relying on a knowledge governance approach, this study presents exploratory empirical evidence indicating that the impacts of a firm's sustainability initiatives on its innovation performance originate from the governance mechanism it uses for sustainability, not sustainability outcomes per se. We tested this research proposition by using a subsample of Global Manufacturing Research Group's global survey data. Our results support the positive impacts of two widely-used environmental sustainability governance mechanisms (i.e., internal monitoring and supplier collaboration) on product innovation capability. The findings further provide more useful and effective options for manufacturing firms and managers, to establish environmental sustainability governance mechanisms that can be converted into product innovation capability. © 2018 by the authors.","Environmental sustainability; Governance mechanism; Internal monitoring; Product innovation; Supplier collaboration","conceptual framework; corporate strategy; empirical analysis; environmental economics; governance approach; innovation; manufacturing; performance assessment; philosophy; sustainability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049221369"

Our study suggests that Qatar's residential PV adoption is strongly promoted by the falling cost of PV and can be further facilitated through the reduction of electricity subsidies and the extension of the electricity tariff to Qatari households, which are currently exempt. The introduction of a carbon tax can also play a role in accelerating residential PV adoption, if above $8 per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent.

In this paper, we revisit the national and regional Innovation Scoreboards using a multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach in the context of the Quadruple Innovation Helix (QIH) framework. We deploy an MCDA approach combining AHP and TOPSIS methods which merges data from Government, University, Industry, and Civil Society sectors (the four QIH actors or helices) and overcomes limitations of the existing Innovation Scoreboard approach by incorporating the different preference systems of the QIH Helix actors. The findings illustrate the power and promise of our approach as an alternative composite innovation metric. Estimating the different preferences of innovation stakeholders gives the ability to develop policies and practices oriented towards specific QIH actors. Estimating the importance that each QIH actor assigns to different innovation aspects is critical policy-wise and practice-wise as it provides a perspective on relative efficacies and potential ways and means to calculate differential efficacies for alternative configurations of resource allocations. These results underlie specific policies, practices, and priorities therein based on the relative re-distribution of weights. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","AHP; Composite innovation metrics; Innovation; Innovation Scoreboard; Innovation systems; MCDA; Quadruple Innovation Helix Framework; TOPSIS","Decision theory; Hierarchical systems; Innovation; Operations research; Regional planning; Alternative configurations; Innovation system; MCDA; Multiple criteria decision analysis; Preference systems; Quadruple Innovation Helix Framework; Regional innovation; TOPSIS; analytical hierarchy process; conceptual framework; decision analysis; estimation method; innovation; multicriteria analysis; stakeholder; Economics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015802455"

The program is a proactive approach for improving the health of frequent callers of 911 who visit emergency departments at least 4 times per year by providing preventative, primary care service and connecting them to outpatient healthcare resources within their local communities. Although current literature abounds with studies measuring quality improvement in healthcare, very few have captured patient experience. More so, peer-reviewed literature measuring success of community paramedicine programs using standardized instruments is sparse. The metrics adopted to measure quality of this program is unique and in 3 parts: (1) validated survey to measure patient health outcomes (SF-12v2); (2) Nationally-used standardized survey to assess patient experience (CAHPS-CG); and (3) Comparative analysis of costs avoided due to decline in EMS encounters for pre-, during- and post-program enrollment time periods. In addition, qualitative data using semi-structured interviews from paramedics provides an in-depth view of the success and underlying perceptions about the program.

We examine two scenarios that are the alternative to each other. The first is what we call the globalization of regional innovation system/weakening of inter-regional hierarchy scenario: As many regions develop their niches in the global economy, the national “anchor” region loses its relative importance as the importer and distributor of new knowledge, rendering the domestic inter-regional hierarchy less significant as a result. The second scenario is the globalization of national innovation system/persistence of inter-regional hierarchy. The nation’s traditional anchor region becomes even more active in importing technology and distributing it to other regions of the country. To test which scenario is closer to reality, we employ social network metrics to analyse inter-regional technology diffusion networks using Chinese patent licensing data for the 1998–2013 period. Our findings support the second scenario, showing that the influence of the traditional anchor region persists in the hierarchical network structure as new cities enter the network. We found five anchor regions: the three usual suspects—Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen—plus two that were slightly less expected—Dongguan and Suzhou. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","Beijing [China]; China; Dongguan; Guangdong; Jiangsu; Shanghai; Shenzhen; Suzhou; global economy; globalization; hierarchical system; innovation; intellectual property rights; social network; technological development; technology diffusion; technology transfer","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055278963"

While there is extensive research in the area of innovation measurement, there is a lack of consistent quantifiable measures that organizations can use. The International Association of Innovation Professionals (IAOIP) has partnered with Spigit to crowdsource innovation measures via the Innovation Measurement Standard (IMS) challenge with IAOIP members and the global public to determine the various ways innovation is measured across industries. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a mixed-methods approach and a sequential exploratory design to analyze the data collected during the IMS challenge. In the first phase, the qualitative methodology was used to analyze innovation measures submitted during the IMS challenge and participants’ interactions and comments. In the second phase, the innovation measures were analyzed quantitatively to identify the most prominent measures. Findings: A total of 73 innovation measures were collected during the challenge. In total, 18 top measures were ranked based on the participants’ votes, and the top five measures were selected as the winning measures of the challenge. These five measures included intelligent failure rate, financial results of innovation, the results brought to the company, the number of innovative ideas selected for action and innovation portfolio balancing. Originality/value: This study is the first to select the innovation metrics while considering their relevance to the community of innovators that included academics, CEOs, consultants, innovation managers, etc. Another original factor of this work is the crowdsourcing approach used to identify innovation measures.

There is rising interest in studying how innovation emerges from the blending of accumulated knowledge, and from which path an innovation mostly inherits. A citation network can be seen as a perfect example of one generative process leading to innovation. However, the impact and influence of scientific publication are always difficult to capture and measure. We offer a new take on investigating how the knowledge circulates and is transmitted, inspired by the notion of “stream of knowledge”. We propose to look at this question under the lens of flows in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). In this framework inspired by the work of Strahler, we can also account for other well known measures of influence such as the h-index. We propose then to analyze flows of influence in a citation networks as an ascending flow. From this point on, we can take a finer look at the diffusion of knowledge through the lens of a multiplex network. In this network, each citation of a specific work constitutes one layer of interaction. Within our framework, we design three measures of multiplex flows in DAGs, namely the aggregated, sum and selective flow, to better understand how citations are influenced. We conduct our experiments with the arXiv HEP-Th dataset, and find insights through the visualization of these multiplex networks. © 2017, The Author(s).","Citation network; Directed acyclic graph (DAG); Flow of knowledge; Large network; Metrics; Multiplex network","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058977657"

Specifically, we use two algorithmic approaches published by others, which measure feature congestion (FC) and subband entropy (SE), as well as our own approach of counting object types rather than individual objects. We compare these metrics with each other as well as with human complexity ratings for three maps of the same area from map providers Google Maps, Bing Maps, and OpenStreetMap. Each map design is assessed at three different scales (levels of detail). We find that (1) the FC and SE metrics appear to be adequate predictors of what humans consider complex; (2) object-type counts are slightly less successful at predicting human-rated complexity, implying that clutter is more important in perceived complexity than diversity of symbology; and (3) generalization choices do impact human complexity ratings.

However, because of historically low natural gas prices and cost reductions for onshore wind and photovoltaic technologies, recent new capacity deployment, especially in the United States, has come largely from these three generation sources. Here, we quantify competitive cost targets for three less-common zero-emission generation technologies—nuclear, concentrating solar, and offshore wind—under a range of future conditions. We determine the cost targets based on the technologies’ system value, such that technology value equals or exceeds its cost. Using a capacity expansion model that develops system-wide, economically optimal generation scenarios of the United States power sector, we find that nuclear, concentrating solar, and offshore wind would need to attain levelized cost ranges of $53–84/MWh, $65–91/MWh, and $39–77/MWh, respectively, to achieve 1% additional grid penetration. We refer to this metric as the “required cost,” which is a technology's levelized cost of energy needed to achieve a specific penetration level. Higher penetrations lead to lower required costs as lower-cost generation is displaced. We estimate that to reach 10% penetration, the required cost for nuclear declines to $45–76/MWh. Because of resource variability and increased transmission needs for concentrating solar power and offshore wind, even lower costs are needed to reach higher penetrations: required cost ranges to achieve 10% penetration are estimated to be $30–56/MWh and $18–40/MWh for these two technologies respectively.

Geographers question the rationalist impulse to quantify and problematize the role of techno-science—models, metrics, accounting protocols, and standards—in performing economic rationalities. The critique of techno-science, however, directs empirical research toward the political economy of knowledge production with little consideration of the role of bureaucratic organization in performing calculations. In this article, I study the bureaucratic work in coordinating the largest agri-environmental PfP program in the United States—the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP). Data for this article were collected in North Dakota, a top-five CSP recipient state. Through semistructured interviews and participant observation of bureaucratic encounters with farmers in localized offices, I found that the situated nature of the street-level bureaucracy placed it in a unique position to interpret, probe, undermine, and promote the PfP agenda. The article argues that data-driven technologies in the CSP were designed with a considerable appetite for imprecision. The appetite for imprecision reflects a structural problem conditioned by the interaction of economic rationality with the nature of technical innovation, administrative rationalities, and political opportunism. Given the momentum to expand data-driven technologies in conservation, the article calls on geographers to consider the dynamic and incomplete ways in which data are mobilized in practice and what efforts to be more transparent eventually conceal. © 2019, © 2019 American Association of Geographers.","accountability; agri-environmental policy; environmental governance; metrics; performativity; street-level bureaucracy","","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062792220"

This paper systematically brings together indicator sets and derives an indicator framework for measuring energy innovation, offering an important step forward in the quantitative evaluation of energy innovation performance. It incorporates input, output and outcome metrics that relate to different stages along the energy technology innovation chain, namely research, development, demonstration, market formation and diffusion. To test its efficacy, the indicator framework is applied to the case of wind energy in China, drawing comparisons against global market leaders such as Denmark, Germany and the USA. The paper finds that the framework enables a more rigorous comparative analysis of energy innovation between countries than currently offered by either the application of piecemeal indicators and complements contextually rich qualitative case studies. The empirical analysis shows that China has begun to lead across a range of innovation inputs (e.g. R&D expenditure) and outputs (e.g. publications) but lags considerably behind international competitors against other output and outcome indicators such as patents, revenue and exports. © 2017","China; Energy technology innovation; Innovation metrics; Innovation system","China; Engineering research; International trade; Patents and inventions; China; Energy; Energy technologies; Energy technology innovation; Indicator frameworks; Innovation metric; Innovation performance; Innovation system; Innovations process; Technology innovation; comparative study; empirical analysis; energy market; innovation; research and development; technology adoption; wind power; Wind power","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032179687"

Design/methodology/approach: It starts with a review of surveys of innovation in the formal business sector, and related definitions, as sources of questions and definitions which could be applied to the informal sector. Then, labor force surveys, and those that are combined with establishment surveys to measure informal sector activities, are examined with a view to adding questions, or modules, on the measurement of innovation in the informal sector. In addition, the advantages of using semi-structured interviews and ad hoc questionnaires in specific sub-sectors of the informal sector are explored. Findings: The discussion leads to a possible agenda for future work on the development of policy relevant indicators of innovation in the informal economy. Two viable scenarios emerge: first, adding innovation questions to existing large-scale surveys of the informal economy; and/or second, conducting ad hoc questionnaire- and interview-based sectoral studies in selected countries. Research limitations/implications: The proposed course of actions suffers from a few shortcomings: first, amending existing surveys as proposed here is always a challenging undertaking. A new survey questions have to be tested (cognitive and other testing); their deployment also depends on the willingness of countries to include new questions. Second, surveying the informal economy and applying proper sampling will remain an issue, no matter how good the survey design, and not matter how sincere the effort. Third, and finally, conducting these new survey techniques will require substantial resources over time. Practical implications: In the coming years, new efforts are planned to gather data and better measure innovation in developing countries, such as the third edition of the African Innovation Outlook. This will widen the scope of reporting and analysis to include coverage of innovations in the informal sector (AU-NEPAD 2014). The suggestions in this chapter are intended to lay important groundwork for future empirical work, to help develop appropriate indicators and support new approaches to innovation policy in developing countries. Pragmatic suggestions are formulated, pointing to potential opportunities and challenges. Social implications: The informal economy is a hugely important contributor to economic growth and social well-being in Africa and other developing countries. Better measurement and contributing to a better understanding of innovation in the informal economy will be important progress. Originality/value: The contribution of the paper lies in the novel combination of tested approaches in informal sector surveys, on the one hand, and innovation surveys in the formal sector, on the other hand. The approaches provide ways forward to gain better understanding of the innovation in the informal economy, and to support innovation policy in African countries and beyond. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Africa; Informal economy; Innovation; Innovation metrics; Intangible assets; Intellectual property","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046822445"

The results suggest that there is a relatively low incidence of training in the region, although there are significant differences across countries and this may be because of heterogeneities in public support and barriers to in-firm training. Also, various firm characteristics affect in-firm training including size, ownership, whether the firm exports, whether the firm is part of a larger organization, innovative activity and workforce structure and educational level. Lastly, the findings suggest that in-firm training in the region may play a relatively small role and may even not matter for innovation and productivity, although this finding may be because of low levels of formal training and the metrics used in defining and measuring in-firm training, innovation and productivity given the data available and limitations of the sample. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","In-firm training; innovation; productivity; Small Island Developing States (SIDS)","Caribbean Islands; innovation; productivity; small island state; training","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054803187"

The studies tend to adopt a narrow perspective to science, technology and innovation and their policies, which do not seem to be sufficient to understand TCA in countries that face the middle-income trap. This adds to the limited metrics we have to measure TCA. This paper argues that it is necessary to frame the TCA processes at national levels, including the techno-economic and the socio-political spheres (TES and SPS). It is argued that countries' evolutionary trajectory combines these spheres differently and results in different development profiles. This is expected to have an impact on their TCA. The objective is to identify and analyse development profiles of Latin American countries (in terms of TES and SPS), and discuss it relationship with the characteristics of TCA at the firm level. This research departures from descriptive statistics based on Innovation Surveys for the TCA analysis at the firm and country level, and combines different steps and tools to asses country development profiles: (i) a long-term analysis (1980–2010) to verify the existence of cointegration between TES and SPS; and (ii) the identification and estimation of long run paths that determine three different country profiles.

The World Economic Forum, Ellen MacArthur Foundation, and McKinsey & Company claimed in 2016 that technological innovations can solve the plastic problem. Such a claim raises an as yet unanswered question: how much technological innovation is needed and is it economically feasible? We offer answers to this question via a system dynamics model that we developed to simulate different scenarios aimed at controlling plastic debris entering the global ocean. Our results show that ocean cleanup technologies could achieve a 25% reduction in the level of plastic debris in the ocean below 2010 levels in 2030. However, this would require removing 15% of the stock of plastic debris from the ocean every year over the period 2020–2030, which equates to 135 million tons of plastic in total (metric tons). The implementation cost of such an ocean cleanup effort would amount to €492 billion-€708 billion, which represents 0.7%–1.0% of the world GDP in 2017 – this calculation is based on unit costs in €/kg estimated in The Ocean Cleanup project feasibility study. The Ocean Cleanup project alone is designed to collect 70,320 tons of plastic debris over a 10 year period. Removing 135 million tons of plastic debris would require investing in 1924 similar cleanup projects. These results help to assess the economic feasibility of removing such large volume of plastics. Moreover, our results provide quantitative confirmation that technological solutions alone are not sufficient to solve plastic pollution issues. A portfolio of diverse solutions – not only technological ones – is likely to have greater technical, political and economic feasibility. Our model shows that such a combined portfolio implemented over the period 2020–2030 could reduce the ocean plastic stock to 2013 levels (94 million tons) by 2030. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Decoupling GDP; Marine ecosystem; Marine litter; Ocean cleanup; System dynamics; Waste management","Aquatic ecosystems; Debris; Economic analysis; Ecosystems; Elastomers; Oceanography; System theory; Waste management; Decoupling GDP; Economic feasibilities; Marine litter; Ocean cleanup; Plastic contamination; System Dynamics; Technological innovation; Technological solution; Gross Domestic Product; innovation; marine ecosystem; marine pollution; plastic; waste management; Article; biodegradability; calculation; cleaning; contamination; cost; environmental impact; environmental protection; feasibility study; plastic waste; priority journal; quantitative analysis; sea pollution; technology; waste component removal; waste management; Biodegradable polymers","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063256948"

In this study, we explore approaches to engagement emerging in the field based on in-depth interviews with editors at a range of news outlets from several countries, and we map these approaches onto the literature on participatory journalism and related innovations in journalism practice. Our findings suggest variation in approaches to engagement that can be arrayed along several related dimensions, encompassing how news outlets measure and practice it (e.g. with the use of quantitative audience metrics methods), whether they think about audiences as more passive or more active users, the stages at which they incorporate audience data or input into the news product, and how skeptically or optimistically they view the audience. Overall, while some outlets are experimenting with tools for more substantive audience contributions to news content, we find few outlets approaching engagement as a way to involve users in the creation of news, with most in our sample focusing mostly on engaging users in back-end reaction and response to the outlet’s content. We identify technological, economic, professional, and organizational factors that shape and constrain how news outlets practice “engagement.”. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","engagement; journalism; media economics; metrics; newsrooms; norms and routines; participatory journalism","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032835670"

In a recent work, it was shown that focusing on couples of technological codes allows for the formation of testable predictions of innovation events, defined as the first time two codes appear together in a patent. In particular, the construction of the vector space of codes and the introduction of the context similarity metric allows for a quantitative analysis of technological progress. Here, we move from that result and we show that, through context similarity, it is possible to assign to countries a score which measures the probability of being the first to patent a potential innovation. In other words, we show that we can not only estimate the likelihood that a potential innovation will be patented in the imminent future, but also forecast where it will be patented. © 2018 by the authors.","Economic studies; Innovation; Machine learning","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056989430"

However, although entrepreneurial intentions in sport sciences students have been studied, less is known about intrapreneurial intentions. It is, therefore, the purpose of this paper to validate a scale to measure the intrapreneurial intentions of sports science students from two different countries. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 304 final-year students from the sport sector of two different countries (Spain and Lithuania) was analyzed. First, an exploratory factorial analysis of the two samples was performed separately, and then a confirmatory factorial analysis was carried out to performed. Finally, in order to check the invariance of the measuring instrument, a multi-group analysis was performed with the constraints of all factors variances and all factors loading. Findings: The entrepreneurial intentions scale works well both in its English version in the Lithuanian sports students’ and in its Spanish version with the university sports students from Spain. Therefore, it can be said that there is a metric invariance. However, the scale presents better fit indexes, reliability and validity in its English version. Lithuanian sports students scored significantly higher on the risk-taking dimension than Spanish students. Research limitations/implications: The scale has only been validated with final-year sport science students from two countries. It is necessary to test this scale with a larger sample of students from different fields and countries. Practical implications: This scale can be used in both in Spanish and English versions to detect potential entrepreneurs in the sports sector, so it can help universities and employers to detect future intraentrepreneurs in the sports sector. Social implications: Social implication of this paper is the detection of potential entrepreneurs who can improve economic, social or sports performance in organizations or sports companies. Originality/value: A new tool to detect the potential sport intrapreneurs in university students has been created. Moreover, a cross-cultural validation of the intrapreneurial intentions scale (in English and Spanish version) with sport sciences students from two different countries has been performed. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Employability; Innovation; Intrapreneurial intentions; Risk taking; Sport intrapreneurs; Sport science students; University policies","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069432574"

This approach, based on risk reduction and reliability, is used to assess the performance of conventional interventions (e.g., flood defences and dams) and to support decisions regarding their implementation. However, for more innovative solutions, performance has often not been quantified by means of these metrics and, therefore, end-users are hesitant to implement them in existing flood risk reduction systems. To overcome the gap between innovators and end-users, we present a framework based on four performance indicators, to ensure the required insights in risk and reliability are provided. The four indicators: effectiveness, durability, reliability and costs, allow end-users to evaluate, select, and implement flood adaptation innovations, and provide innovators with insight into the performance of the technology and the criteria and information necessary for successful market uptake of their innovation. The practical application of the framework is demonstrated for a (hypothetical) case of a hospital complex built in an area that has subsided below the surrounding area, which is subject to tropical rain showers.

After a brief introduction analysing the strategic contexts in which innovation in general, and IT in particular, can be a source of general improvements in efficiency, cost savings and service quality, the research focuses on the healthcare system by discussing the different nature of private and public organizations in terms of adopting innovations and changes and discussing the issue of consumer health costs and consumer choices. The following part focuses on the qualitative benefits of IT in healthcare and discusses the importance of metrics for measuring performance, costs and efficiency in this area. The work then qualitatively introduces a new set of Key Performance Indicators (KPI), partly based on literature from different topics and existing and validated sets of metrics, analysing, under the point of view of sustainability, the implementation of IT in healthcare, namely in management, organization, technology, environment and social fields (HHC-MOTES framework).

In this vein, the inclusion of innovative research and innovation policies, such as Responsible Research and Innovation, devoted to mainstream social outcomes, to deploy democratic governance of science, and to drive innovation into a direction that is ethically acceptable, societally desirable and sustainable are noteworthy. However, substantial efforts are required when it comes to integrate the interactions between renewable energy research and energy and climate policies within responsible approaches. In order to adapt responsible research and innovation approach for the purpose of building an alternative context and assessment approach for sustainable transitions, this paper presents a review of approaches around sustainability and social justice dimensions. The thresholds of this endeavour are detailed in terms of the challenges for the integration, the identification of the inhibitors and facilitators of policy integration and the proposal of the levels for a methodology for this integration. The results show that the different readings and understanding of the contexts and dimensions and the existence of knowledge gaps between policy targets and the outcomes of research and innovation can be considered inhibitors for the integration. In contrast the interlinks between dimensional concepts, backgrounds and rationales appear as facilitators. The innovative contribution of this paper is focused on the contextualization of the dimensions through the use of socio-technical and multi/inter/trans and cross-disciplinary approaches. The authors conclude that the process of introducing a more holistic and alternative approach opens the re-envision of policy elements. Moreover, RRI offers an innovative perspective to the transition approach as well as tools for decision-making and policy processes assessment, in an arena where constant innovation is taking place and new structures, processes and metrics are necessary to guide this process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Policy integration; Responsibility; Responsible research and innovation (RRI); Social justice; Sustainability; Sustainability assestment frameworks","Europe; Decision making; Integration; Assessment approaches; Cross-disciplinary approaches; Energy and climate policies; Innovation approach; Policy integration; Responsibility; Responsible research and innovation (RRI); Social justice; alternative energy; assessment method; decision making; democracy; environmental indicator; environmental policy; governance approach; innovation; policy making; research work; social justice; sustainability; Sustainable development","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067068396"

The questionnaires were carried out in the e-survey format and the analyzes were carried out taking into account the interviewee level of education and the level of knowledge that he/she had in relation to Design Thinking and indicators. The results demonstrated the difficulty of defining specific indicators for projects that use Design Thinking since most of the interviewees did not demonstrate minimal conceptual knowledge regarding the methodology and the Design Thinking process, as well as the definition and application of indicators.

An innovation usually has positive as well as negative impacts on people, making its normative assessment a major research challenge. This has become increasingly recognized in the innovation literature. At the same time, subjective well-being (SWB) research has developed and matured largely independently of innovation studies. This paper puts forward a general conceptual framework of the (social) innovation–SWB nexus as a step towards the development of a unified normative “well-being theory of innovation” that applies to all types of innovation, e.g. social as well as technological innovation. Its main feature is the inclusion of multiple direct and indirect SWB impacts of processes as well as of outcomes. The framework can act as a focussing device that raises awareness of the many potential SWB impacts of innovation. SWB impacts should be used as an additional metric in the assessment of innovation, complementing other assessment approaches. © 2017, © 2017 The European Association for the Advancement of the Social Sciences.","(social) innovation–subjective well-being nexus; procedural utility; social innovation; technological innovation; well-being theory of innovation","conceptual framework; innovation; technological development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018173569"

We also expound on the arguments between two schools of thought (single tax and dual tax proponents) toward understanding the rationale underlying the divergent viewpoints. The methodological approach applies the discounted cash flow modeling framework to evaluate the performances of terrain-based projects using selected metrics, such as internal rate of return, discounted payout, net present value, and government take (GT) under the two tax systems. This approach calibrates the unit technical cost for typical deepwater projects in Nigeria and imposes the current and proposed fiscal terms. Varying cost treatment options and alternative allowables//incentives are investigated in the modeling framework using global best practices. We conclude that whichever tax system is adopted, it is possible to achieve equivalent economic metrics. However, the DTS presents a better, more flexible option over the STS because one of the split rates—especially the hydrocarbon resource tax—could serve as an instrument to incentivize investment, promote conservation, and expand the resource base through technology innovation more easily without denying the mineral owner an outright revenue through taxation. In a classical case such as Nigeria, in which the national fiscal budget is largely financed using hydrocarbon revenue, the DTS seemingly offers a better option for revenue sharing among the stakeholders—the resource owners and the Federal Government—than the current single upstream tax system. Our discussion in this paper bridges the gap between the divergent viewpoints on the taxation system in Nigeria by proffering a pathway. We suggest that the overall objectives of stakeholders could be achieved using either STS or DTS metrics if the mechanics in designing the fiscal system is better understood. This will lead to progressive application in achieving divergent expectations.

At Higher Colleges of Technology (HCT) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), learners do Strategic Management and business simulation courses during the third year of their Bachelor's degree. By the time they do the business simulation course, they will already have taken at least one or two courses in each of marketing, management, accounting, business statistics, international business, finance and innovation and entrepreneurship. These students already have an introductory exposure to the main concepts that comprise the business core. Theoretically, they are ready to test their knowledge, understanding and skills at the applied learning level. Thus business simulation is seen as a capstone course for the business-core courses. For this study, comparative performance metrics in the student group project, student self-reflective statements, overall placement in the simulation game and total shareholder return of a simulated mobile phone company are matched to the data visualisation graphics. Data visualisation is enabled by KH Coder, an unsupervised machine learning, quantitative text-analysis process. Technologies used in the analysis include correlation co-occurrence networks, centrality co-occurrence networks and multidimensional scaling. A linkage is struck between high performance in the business simulation course via a set of metrics and the visual content of the graphics, representing students' understanding of the simulation. The high performing teams in the simulation-those who best modelled overall competitive and financial success in the game-exhibited a unique pattern of understanding. Using a pattern-matching approach, a clear data structure emerges that separates high-performing teams from their competitors. This study documents success via modelling innovation and entrepreneurship through participation in strategic management and business simulation courses. The results highlight the importance of learner participation in overall innovation and entrepreneurship education, and the financial literacy gained from participating in business simulation. While business simulation is currently a hot topic, limited research is available from the Middle East connecting entrepreneurship and innovation to success in business simulation.

The queues energy waste has been calculated to provide an assessment for the ineffective use of computation-related energy load within the Cluster.

By treating journalistic objectivity not as a stable referent, but as a contextual one prone to shifts in practices and understandings over time, it foregrounds how changing technologies of recording, creating, and distributing news content affect how journalistic objectivity is understood. Following this perspective, two technological practices are examined: photojournalism and algorithms. The development of photojournalism led to the prizing of news images as objective representations produced by the camera to the diminishment of human judgment. Similarly, the various outputs produced by news algorithms are accompanied by an orientation toward computational objectivity in contrast to human subjectivity. Exploring these dynamics sheds light on the ongoing relationship between news technologies and discourses of journalistic objectivity in the face of digital innovations in the production and circulation of news. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","algorithms; automated journalism; Epistemology; journalism; mechanical objectivity; metrics; objectivity; photojournalism","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064560186"

Between, say, video consultation or a remote patient monitoring application (i.e. patient-facing digital health innovations) and in-person consultation? To answer this question, we sought to identify measures which are used in randomised controlled trials. But first we used two theories to frame the effects of patient-facing digital health innovations on - 1) transaction costs (i.e. the effort, time and costs required to complete a clinical interaction); and 2) process outcomes and clinical outcomes along the care cascade or information value chain, such that the 'value of information' (VoI) is different at each point in the care cascade or value chain. From the trials, we identified three categories of measures: outcome (process or clinical), satisfaction, and cost. We found that although patient-facing digital health innovations tend to confer much of their value by altering process outcomes, satisfaction, and transaction costs, these measures are inconsistently assessed. Efforts to determine the relative value of and choose between mediums of service delivery should adopt a metric (i.e. mathematical combination of measures) that capture all dimensions of value. We argue that 'value of information' (VoI) is such a metric - it is calculated as the difference between the 'expected utility' (EU) of alternative options. But for patient-facing digital health innovations, 'expected utility' (EU) should incorporate the probability of achieving not only a clinical outcome, but also process outcomes (depending on the innovation under consideration); and the measures of utility should include satisfaction and transaction costs; and also changes in population access to services, and health system capacity to deliver more services, which may result from reduction in transaction costs. © 2019 The Author(s).","Digital health; Innovation; Satisfaction; Telehealth; Transaction costs; Utility; Value of information","adult; case report; clinical article; clinical outcome; female; human; male; probability; randomized controlled trial (topic); review; satisfaction; telehealth","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068573367"

Impact reporting should identify and examine the potential positive and negative consequences of the continuing operations of a proposed project and suggest strategies to expand, further develop, mitigate, avoid or offset them. Designing a tool or methodology that will capture the impact of collaborative research and innovation projects related to sustainability requires input from technical experts but also from experts in the domains of survey design and communication. Without survey design insights and testing it can be very difficult to achieve unambiguous and accurate reporting of impacts. This paper proposes six key recommendations that should be considered for those monitoring projects when identifying metrics and designing a sustainability impact report. These recommendations stem from a series of in-depth interviews about sustainability and innovation impact reporting with research project co-ordinators in the process industries (e.g., cement, ceramics, chemicals, engineering, minerals and ores, non-ferrous metals, steel and water sectors). Our results show that factors such as ambiguous terminology, two-in-one questions, the stage of the project, over-hypothetical estimates, inadequate formats and alternatives and lack of guidelines can negatively influence the data collected in usual project monitoring activities and jeopardise the overall validity of the reporting. This work acts as a guideline for those monitoring to improve how they ask for impact data from projects, whether they are introducing new impact metrics or evaluating existing ones. © 2019 by the authors.","Impact reporting; Metrics; Process industries; Project monitoring; Survey design; Sustainability","design method; environmental impact assessment; expert system; guideline; industrial technology; monitoring system; project assessment; project management; research work; survey design; sustainability; testing method","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063444434"

However, like prior advances in information technology, the ability of firms to exploit these opportunities depends on a variety of complementary human capital and organizational capabilities. We focus on whether analytics is more valuable in firms where innovation within a firm has decentralized groups of inventors or centralized ones. Our analysis draws on prior work measuring firm-analytics capability using detailed employee-level data and matches these data to metrics on intrafirm inventor networks that reveal whether a firm’s innovation structure is centralized or decentralized. In a panel of 1,864 publicly traded firms from the years 1988–2013, we find that firms with a decentralized innovation structure have a greater demand for analytics skills and receive greater productivity benefits from their analytics capabilities, consistent with a complementarity between analytics and decentralized innovation. We also find that analytics helps decentralized structures to create new combinations and reuse of existing technologies, consistent with the ability of analytics to link knowledge across diverse domains and to integrate external knowledge into the firm. Furthermore, the effect primarily comes from the analytics capabilities of the noninventor employees as opposed to inventors themselves. These results show that the benefit of analytics on innovation depends on existing organizational structures. Similar to the IT–productivity paradox, these results can help explain a contemporary analytics–innovation paradox—the apparent slowdown in innovation despite the recent increase in analytics investments. © 2019 INFORMS.","AI; Automation; Big data; Data analytics; Decentralization; Economics of IS; Innovation; Novel innovation; Organizational complements; Productivity; Recombination","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Big data; Economics; Personnel; Productivity; Decentralization; Decentralized structures; Economics of is; Organizational capabilities; Organizational complements; Organizational structures; Productivity paradox; Recombination; Data Analytics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075350653"

Results from our research on measuring training effectiveness, enable us to assess the efficacy of training devices and content. Results demonstrate that assessment of training effectiveness must capture training readiness in terms of task performance with acceptable levels of cognitive workload. Using the training effectiveness research data, we designed Deep Neural Networks to predict student performance. Results show that when cognitive workload is included as a feature in the DNN, it significantly increases the performance prediction to an extremely high level of accuracy.

A theory of change may provide a useful tool to track progress towards desired outcomes. The Saving Lives at Birth partnership aims to address inequities in maternal-newborn survival through the provision of strategic investments for the development, testing and transition-to-scale of ground-breaking prevention and treatment approaches with the potential to leapfrog conventional healthcare approaches in low resource settings. We aimed to develop a theory of change and impact framework with prioritised metrics to map the initiative's contribution towards overall goals, and to measure progress towards improved outcomes around the time of birth. Methods: A theory of change and impact framework was developed retrospectively, drawing on expertise across the partnership and stakeholders. This included a document and literature review, and wide consultation, with feedback from stakeholders at all stages. Possible indicators were reviewed from global maternal-newborn health-related partner initiatives, priority indicator lists, and project indicators from current innovators. These indicators were scored across five domains to prioritise those most relevant and feasible for Saving Lives at Birth. These results informed the identification of the prioritised metrics for the initiative. Results: The pathway to scale through Saving Lives at Birth is articulated through a theory of change and impact framework, which also highlight the roles of different actors involved in the programme. A prioritised metrics toolkit, including ten core impact indicators and five additional process indicators, complement the theory of change. The retrospective nature of this development enabled structured reflection of the program mechanics, allowing for inclusion of learning from the first four rounds of the program to inform implementation of subsequent rounds. Conclusions: While theories of change are more traditionally developed before program implementation, retrospective development can still be a useful exercise for multi-round programs like Saving Lives at Birth, where outputs from the development can be used to strengthen subsequent rounds. However, identifying a uniform set of prioritised metrics for use across the portfolio proved more challenging. Lessons learnt from this exercise will be relevant to the development of pathways to change across other Grand Challenges and global health platforms. © 2018 The Author(s).","Impact metrics; Indicators; Innovation; Maternal health; Neonatal health; Stillbirth; Theory of change","Female; Global Health; Health Promotion; Humans; Infant; Infant Health; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; Maternal Health; Maternal Mortality; Models, Theoretical; Pregnancy; Program Evaluation; Retrospective Studies; birth date; health care; innovation; maternal health; mortality; theoretical study; Article; clinical indicator; conceptual framework; consultation; feasibility study; feedback system; global health; health care planning; health program; maternal health service; medical expert; newborn care; priority journal; professional practice; program development; child health; female; global health; health promotion; human; infant; infant mortality; maternal mortality; maternal welfare; newborn; pregnancy; procedures; program evaluation; retrospective study; theoretical model; trends","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041193831"

Despite the relevance of the issue, few contributions deepen such a relationship after both a conceptual and a quantitative perspective. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to suggest a measure of sustainability for innovation processes and to define which innovation strategies can lead to more sustainable processes. The role of ambidexterity within the corporate sustainability framework is underlined: Ambidextrous organizations are able to improve the innovation performance and better use their resources, improving the sustainability of research and development (R & D) processes. By employing patent data and testing the framework on a sample of worldwide top R & D spending companies in the IT hardware industry, this work suggests which optimal value of ambidexterity will lead to more sustainable innovation. In addition, R & D processes with non-optimal levels of ambidexterity can be managed in a better way. Indeed, results show the usefulness of open innovation adoption to improve the performance of exploration processes. Moreover, R & D activities based on a preponderance of exploitation strategies are more sustainable if they fall into technological domains in which the focal company is highly specialized. The work also contributes to the conceptualization of sustainability and to definition of patent-based metrics related to sustainability. © 2019 by the authors.","Ambidexterity; Exploitation vs. exploration; Innovation; Innovation performance; Open innovation; Patent data; Specialization; Sustainability; Technological strategies","exploitation; exploration; hardware; information technology; innovation; performance assessment; sustainability; technology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070741111"

Political decisions generate changes in their environment and in producing change they seek constant adaptations, which in turn leads to contradictions, inconsistencies, truths, falsehoods. So soon, studies of the non-classical logical calls [2] have become a tool as an aid in the making of decisions. The logic calls attention to the brilliance of containing provisions contrary to some of the basic principles of Aristotelian Logic, such as the contradiction. In this article, the use of the technology allows proposing a structured decision making contained in the unified process Paraconsistent Logic.

While the effect of entrepreneurial orientation (EO) on innovation is enhanced by architectural marketing capabilities, the effect of innovation outcomes on profits is enhanced by specialized marketing capabilities. Ultimately, the pathway from EO to performance, mediated by innovation, is positively significant at higher levels of both marketing capabilities.

Radically innovating new products and services to replace harmful market incumbents is central to this thesis, yet studies to date have found it to be a highly expensive process with high degrees of uncertainty and risk. Extant research however has largely neglected to examine the details of the actual product innovation process itself and has under appreciated the influence of corporate strategic context. Our paper addresses this gap in the literature through an in-depth case study of a sustainability oriented innovation process for a radical new product within a multinational life sciences company, DSM. Our findings identify five critical organizational practices through which strategic direction has enabled the innovation process: technology super-scouting throughout the value chain, search heuristics that favor radical sustainability solutions, integration of sustainability performance metrics in product development, championing the value chain to build demand for radical sustainability oriented product innovation, and harnessing the benefits of open innovation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","","Chains; Competition; Heuristic algorithms; Sustainable development; Competitive advantage; Life sciences companies; Organizational practices; Product innovation process; Products and services; Strategic direction; Sustainability performance; Uncertainty and risks; competitiveness; heuristics; innovation; performance assessment; strategic approach; sustainability; Innovation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85035143826"

While related variety has been found to be positively associated with several indicators of regional economic development and technological innovation, it remains unclear whether its merits also benefit innovation in creative industries. As innovation in creative industries is based on symbolic knowledge, the degree of variety in local contexts may affect the creativity of artists differently than the innovativeness of engineers and scientists. To test whether specialization, unrelated variety, or (semi)related variety is linked to innovation in creative industries, this contribution applies the concept of related variety to the context of urban music scenes. As innovation in creative industries is hidden from traditional innovation data, we utilize volunteered, geographic, and user-generated information from the social music platform last.fm. From relatedness measures between music genres, we generate our own classification system of music, which is used to calculate different related variety metrics of music scenes. Furthermore, our database allows for the identification of innovation in music as the emergence and combination of music genres. The results of this article suggest that semirelated variety promotes innovation in music, while related variety is only positively associated with combinatorial knowledge dynamics. Additionally, specialization limits innovation in music scenes. Hence, policy concerned with creative industries needs to analyze not only aggregate data but also the composition of regional symbolic knowledge bases. © 2019, © 2019 Clark University.","creative industry; innovation; music; related variety; symbolic knowledge","creative industry; economic development; innovation; knowledge; music; regional economy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062729855"

This conference utilized innovative approaches to facilitate a process of constructive, critical reflection of the existing climate risk management knowledge base, as well as its relevance to decision-maker needs and views of the most vulnerable people. The conference articulated recommendations to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in the development of their Sixth Assessment Report (AR6)–in support of the Chair’s vision for AR6 to have a strong focus on solutions. This report highlights key recommendations distilled from these discussions in areas such as risk-framing approaches and risk metrics.

It is the physical state between health and disease, characterised by the perception of health complaints, general weakness, chronic fatigue and low energy levels. We have developed a tool to measure SHS, Suboptimal Health Status Questionnaire-25 (SHSQ-25) which assesses five components of health: (1) fatigue, (2) the cardiovascular system, (3) the digestive tract, (4) the immune system, and (5) mental status. To date, the SHSQ-25 as a self-reported survey instrument has been validated in various populations, including African, Chinese and Caucasians, therefore generating an unprecedented opportunity for the early detection of chronic health conditions, namely, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Our studies suggest that SHS is associated with the major components of cardiovascular health. We investigated the association between SHS and cardiovascular health metrics (defined by American Heart Association) among Chinese. Participants in the largest quartile of ideal cardiovascular health (CVH) metrics showed a lower likelihood of having on optimal SHS score compared to those in the smallest quartile after adjusting for socio-demographic factors (age, gender, marital status, alcohol consumption, income level and education). Four metrics (smoking, physical inactivity, poor dietary intake and ideal control of blood pressure) were significantly correlated with the risk of SHS. The study indicated that ideal CVH metrics were associated with a lower prevalence of SHS, and the combined evaluation of SHS and CVH metrics allows the risk classification of cardiovascular disease, consequently contributing to the prevention of cardiovascular diseases from a preventive, predicative and personalised medicine perspective (PPPM). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Age; Alcohol consumption; Blood pressure; Cardiovascular deficits; Chinese; Chinese population; Chronic health condition; Digestive tract; Education; Fatigue; Gender; Immune system; Income level; Innovation; Marital status; Mental status; Metrics; Physical inactivity; Poor dietary intake; Predictive preventive personalised medicine; Questionnaire; Risks classification; Self-reported survey; Smoking; Socio-demographic factor; Strategy; Suboptimal health","cholesterol; creatinine; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; very low density lipoprotein cholesterol; alcohol consumption; anthropometric parameters; blood pressure; blood pressure regulation; body mass; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; dietary intake; disease association; educational status; endothelial dysfunction; family income; fatigue; health behavior; health care personnel; health status; human; hypertension; ICD-10; immune system; lifestyle; marriage; mental health; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; occupation; personalized medicine; physical inactivity; predictive value; priority journal; questionnaire; risk assessment; smoking; socioeconomics; suboptimal health status questionnaire 25","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077331344"

We adopted a documentary research design, as we examined the policies produced by governmental bodies and agencies at the three governmental levels in Brazil - federation, states, and cities. Also, qualitative content analysis was performed in order to organize, codify and interpret the messages delivered by current innovation policies in the country. We found that most public policies on innovation and small businesses are short-sighted and generalist, borrowing metrics and evaluation criteria from the big enterprise context in an one-size-fits-all manner that, ultimately, cannot be applied to most small businesses and local contexts. As a contribution to theory, our five propositions could be used as starting points for future policy and administration research. On a practical level, we propose recommendations to policy-makers and offer insights on how an adequate policy affects a country’s competitiveness and socioeconomic development. © 2019, ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

This research integrates theories of interpersonal communication and consumer learning to explore this question. Analyzing a unique data set of millions of consumer word-of-mouth transmissions (eWOM) on social media regarding 345 new automobile products introduced during 2008–2015, we find that more innovative products generate more eWOM volume but surprisingly less positive sentiment. These effects vary in magnitude across eWOM channels. However, the use of rich-content communication, pre-announcement, and cobranding strengthens (weakens) the positive (negative) effect of product innovativeness on eWOM volume (sentiment). The results further indicate that eWOM sentiment is a stronger predictor of new product success than eWOM volume. Experimental results reveal more insights into how product innovativeness influences eWOM metrics in several product categories and shed light on the role of excitement and perceived risk as mechanisms underlying these effects. The research offers useful implications for firms to design effective viral marketing campaigns to enhance new product success. © 2018","Brand strategy; Diffusion; Field experiment; Innovation; Social media; Word of mouth","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055118982"

Fast changing conditions that characterize current software markets have favored methods advocating speed and flexibility. Agile and Lean software development are in the forefront of these methods. This chapter presents a unified view of Agile software development, Lean software development, and most recent advances toward rapid releases. First, we introduce the area and explain the reasons why the software development industry begun to move into this direction in the late 1990s. Section 2 characterizes the research trends on Agile software development. This section helps understand the relevance of Agile software development in the research literature. Section 3 provides a walk through the roots of Agile and Lean thinking, as they originally emerged in manufacturing. Section 4 develops into Agile and Lean for software development. Main characteristics and most popular methods and practices of Agile and Lean software development are developed in this section. Section 5 centers on rapid releases, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment, the latest advances in the area to get speed. The concepts of DevOps, as a means to take full (end-to-end) advantage of Agile and Lean, and Lean start-up, as an approach to foster innovation, are the focus of the two following Sections 6 and 7. Finally, Section 8 focuses on two important aspects of Agile and Lean software development: (1) metrics to guide decision making and (2) technical debt as a mechanism to gain business advantage.

Australia approved the cultivation of GM canola through a science-based risk assessment in 2003, but allowed state moratoria to be instituted based on potential trade impacts over the period 2004 to 2008 and 2010 in the main canola growing states. This analysis constructs a counterfactual assessment using Canadian GM canola adoption data to create an S-Curve of adoption in Australia to measure the environmental and economic opportunity costs of Australia's SEC-based moratoria between 2004 and 2014. The environmental impacts are measured through the amount of chemical active ingredients applied during pest management, the Environmental Impact Quotient indicator, and greenhouse gas emissions. The economic impacts are measured through the variable costs of the weed control programs, yield and the contribution margin. The environmental opportunity costs from delaying the adoption of GM canola in Australia include an additional 6.5 million kilograms of active ingredients applied to canola land; a 14.3% increase in environmental impact to farmers, consumers and the ecology; 8.7 million litres of diesel fuel burned; and an additional 24.2 million kilograms of greenhouse gas (GHG) and compound emissions released. The economic opportunity costs of the SEC-based moratoria resulted in foregone output of 1.1 million metric tonnes of canola and a net economic loss to canola farmers' of AU$485.6 million. The paper provides some of the first quantified, post-adoption evidence on the opportunity cost and environmental impacts of incorporating SECs into GM crop regulation. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.","biotechnology; Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety; food security; innovation; opportunity cost; socio-economic considerations","Australia; Brassica napus; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Crops, Agricultural; Environment; Greenhouse Gases; Plants, Genetically Modified; Weed Control; analysis; Australia; cost benefit analysis; crop; economics; environment; genetics; greenhouse gas; growth, development and aging; rapeseed; transgenic plant; weed control","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042947403"

Never has that tension been greater than the present day, when metrics about student academic success and pressure about career preparation are each the subject of increased scrutiny. STEM education straddles this debate, demanding an equal measure of both rigor and relevance. Therein lies its unique challenge. Beyond the familiar vocabulary of job training, linked learning, and twenty-first century skills, STEM teachers must create a combined learning experience that has no precedent in education. In addition to improving student proficiency in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math, they must deliver the real-world component of the STEM curriculum, often a daunting task. Here, the authors maintain that American waterways, near which the vast majority of the U.S. population lives, are ideal STEM classrooms that can fulfill the interdisciplinary and experiential goals of STEM while helping schools rediscover the larger environmental community. The authors present their experience with the Curriculum and Community Enterprise for New York Harbor Restoration in New York City Public Schools (CCERS), a program of student education and teacher training through direct participation in the planning and physical implementation of oyster restoration in New York Harbor. They argue that if STEM’s promise is that society will reap the benefits of a future job force and future innovation, community professionals such as scientists, engineers, policy makers, and more have a duty to participate as volunteer adjuncts to help implement such programs in local school systems, particularly in underserved communities. © 2018, AESS.","Citizen science; Community partnerships; Environmental restoration; Habitat science; Inquiry-based learning; STEM education","New York Harbor; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States; Ostreidae; citizenship; education; environmental restoration; habitat restoration; innovation; policy making; student; teacher training; urban area","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068856860"

In the operating room and beyond, they combine technical skill with creative problem solving to improve tools and techniques for patient care, making them natural innovators. However, despite their innovative tendencies, education on entrepreneurship and commercialization is severely lacking. Moreover, with increasing pressure to meet productivity metrics, their availability to learn the complexities of commercialization is limited. To address these challenges, we designed the Surgery Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Program (SIEDP) with the objective to advance faculty innovations, develop new departmental innovation initiatives, and improve faculty education in the area of innovation, entrepreneurship, and commercialization. Design: The SIEDP is a first-of-its-kind experiential learning program specifically designed for busy clinical and research faculty in a major academic surgery department. Participants ideated and formed teams around health care innovations as they progressed through a 9-month curriculum of expert guest lectures and interactive workshops. A postprogram evaluation and outcome tracking method was used to evaluate attainment of educational objectives and project development milestones. Setting: The Department of Surgery, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan. Participants: Eleven surgery faculty of varying academic rank and surgical subspecialties. Results: The program generated 2 faculty startup companies, 1 departmental commercial product, 3 patent disclosures, and 3 innovations that received additional funding. All participants in the program reported a significant increase in their understanding of innovation and entrepreneurship and that participation was a worthwhile faculty development activity. Conclusion: Despite the various challenges and time constraints of surgical practices, programs like SIEDP can educate surgeons and other academicians on innovation, entrepreneurship, and commercialization and add value to the academic mission of providing excellent education, research, and clinical care. © 2017 The Authors","commercialization; entrepreneurship; faculty development; innovation; Interpersonal and Communication Skills; Patient Care; Systems-Based Practice","Diffusion of Innovation; Entrepreneurship; Faculty, Medical; Humans; Inventions; Michigan; Problem-Based Learning; Program Development; Schools, Medical; Surgical Procedures, Operative; Article; curriculum; entrepreneurship; experiential learning; funding; health care; health program; human; medical expert; medical school; mental capacity; Michigan; priority journal; program evaluation; surgery innovation and entrepreneurship development program; surgical training; workshop; education; invention; mass communication; problem based learning; program development; surgery; trends","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85030767851"

These research programs have long-term objectives and may not deliver their outcomes for many years. It has long been understood that small incremental gains in progress are often not a good indicator of the eventual achievement of a program’s long-term objectives. So how can governments and corporations ensure that their investment is funding the right research programs? There has been a significant amount of research into what research programs need to be successful. The findings of such research can be summarised in three points: programming (identifying clear research goals that only fundamental research can solve); ring-fencing (defining a contained program of work which is independent of other short term requirements, parallel income-generating consultancy or intermediate product development); and monitoring (evaluating the outputs and outcomes of research programs). The first two points are relatively easy to achieve, the third can be difficult. While research programs require monitoring to gauge which research groups are performing well and to inform future funding allocations. Output metrics (often called perverse metrics by frustrated researchers) such as the number of journal publications, the impact factors of published papers, or numbers of graduating PhD students, are typical measures used to assess research performance. However, when funding agencies publish the metrics they will use to determine funding allocations, researchers’ need to remain competitive for funding results in a shift in their focus. Research focus shifts from meeting the primary objectives (research) to meeting short-term output requirements as dictated by the funding agency’s metrics. Significant research shows the negative effect of these metrics on true, forward looking, fundamental research. We argue that to stimulate fundamental research, performance metrics need to change their focus from monitoring outputs to monitoring inputs. The purpose of assessment is to fund research that is likely to achieve high level objectives. However, with fundamental research, past progress may not indicate future major discoveries. The timing of such discoveries cannot be controlled and therefore performance assessments should not focus on outputs. What can be controlled is the fundamental research-enabling environment; these inputs should be assessed to support future fundamental discoveries. An environment that fosters fundamental research will lead to fundamental research. In this paper we present four input categories of measures relating to the research environment where assessments should focus. These categories cover various characteristics of the research environment that includes the following: the right people, adequate resourcing, defining the goals, allocating time, putting in place processes to encourage the research and promoting a culture of collaboration. For each of these categories we provide several examples of metrics that could be used. © 2017 Proceedings - 22nd International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2017.

These include products, services, organizational processes, or policies that improve access, cost, or efficiency of healthcare. However, given the challenge of replication, it is difficult to identify innovations that could be successfully adapted to high-income settings. We present a set of criteria for evaluating the potential impact of LMIC innovations in HIC settings. Methods: An initial framework was drafted based on a literature review, and revised iteratively by applying it to LMIC examples from the Center for Health Market Innovations (CHMI) program database. The resulting criteria were then reviewed using a modified Delphi process by the Reverse Innovation Working Group, consisting of 31 experts in medicine, engineering, management and political science, as well as representatives from industry and government, all with an expressed interest in reverse innovation. Results: The resulting 8 criteria are divided into two steps with a simple scoring system. First, innovations are assessed according to their success within the LMIC context according to metrics of improving accessibility, cost-effectiveness, scalability, and overall effectiveness. Next, they are scored for their potential for spread to HICs, according to their ability to address an HIC healthcare challenge, compatibility with infrastructure and regulatory requirements, degree of novelty, and degree of current collaboration with HICs. We use examples to illustrate where programs which appear initially promising may be unlikely to succeed in a HIC setting due to feasibility concerns. Conclusions: This study presents a framework for identifying reverse innovations that may be useful to policymakers and funding agencies interested in identifying novel approaches to addressing cost and access to care in HICs. We solicited expert feedback and consensus on an empirically-derived set of criteria to create a practical tool for funders that can be used directly and tested prospectively using current databases of LMIC programs. © 2017 The Author(s).","Global health; Healthcare delivery models; Innovation; Low- and middle-income countries; Reverse innovation","Cooperative Behavior; Delivery of Health Care; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Diffusion of Innovation; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Internationality; Learning; Qualitative Research; Delphi analysis; developing world; health care; innovation; learning; literature review; modeling; public health; Article; cost effectiveness analysis; data base; engineering; health care access; health care concepts; health care innovation; health care management; health care quality; high income country; low income country; medical expert; medicine; middle income country; political science; politics; scoring system; classification; cooperation; developed country; developing country; economics; health care delivery; human; international cooperation; learning; mass communication; procedures; qualitative research; standards","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85010375271"

Although this technology has potential to help understand, analyse and suggest decision-making processes and public policy solutions for a myriad of urban morphologies, spatial layouts, roadway designs, built environments, and landscape types, its applicability to complex social situations remains understudied. Social interactions within unmediated urban settings are rather difficult to predict and can potentially lead to the perpetuation of social injustices. It is known that such unfair behaviours usually place disproportionate burdens on those whom, quite often, cannot do much to preclude future recurrent practices from repeating themselves under the same or slightly different circumstances. I argue that space syntax thinking and methodologies can also be utilized to reduce, and, perhaps, eradicate many of those social problems especially in cities. The paper analyses the potential use of traditional and innovative social and community oriented planning instruments and concepts, such as social impact assessments (SIA), social audits, social capital indicators and metrics, social sustainability, and social innovation through the lenses of space syntax methodologies.","Social impact methodologies; Social innovation.; Societal complexity; Space Syntax","Decision making; Highway planning; Innovation; Syntactics; Decision making process; Indicators and metrics; Social impact; Social impact assessments; Social innovations; Social sustainability; Societal complexity; Space syntax; Economic and social effects","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85031101287"

Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are at the crux of this political strategy. The paper reviews how HEIs can propel regional socio-economic growth and development by way of re-search innovation and entrepreneurship. Background Offering an academic perspective about the role of HEIs using the Penta Helix innovation network for business and social innovation, the paper discusses op-portunities and challenges in gestating an innovation culture. It likewise seeks, identifies and details strategies and workable programs. Methodology Best-practice innovation campaigns initiated by Omani HEIs in collaboration with capstone programs organized by the government were parsed from select-ed local and international literature. The study includes a causal analysis of in-novation information contained in 40 out of 44 published OAAA Quality Audit reports about HEIs from 2009 to 2016. The best-practice programs serve as success indicators and will be used as a field metric effect a Penta Helix blue-print for innovation. Contribution The paper discusses how HEIs can engender, nurture, drive, and sustain inno-vation and entrepreneurial activity by using an innovation strategic blueprint like the Penta Helix model. It gathers together the recent historical attempts at promoting innovation by HEIs. It likewise suggests the creation of a network channel to allow key players in the innovation network to share innovation in-formation and to collaborate with each other. Furthermore, it contributes to the development of innovation culture in HEIs. Findings Expectations run high in academia. For one, universities believe that all innova-tions embryonically begin within their halls. Universities-too-believe it is natu-rally incumbent on them to stimulate and advance innovation despite that most innovation programs are initiated by the government in Oman. HEI engage-ment is perceivably still weak. HEIs have yet to come out as a strong leading force in promoting systems of innovation. There is clear awareness of the need to adopt leading-edge practices in innovation strategy and management, curricu-lum and assessment, staff support and reward systems, funding and ICT infra-structure, research commercialization and IP management, and community en-gagement. Recommendations for Practitioners There is need to conduct more in-depth analyses about the synergy and part-nerships between key players of the Penta Helix model. A large-scale survey will help completely reveal the status and impact of innovation practices in the re-gion and among HEIs.

The licensing of university discoveries offers important benefits; in 2014, academic research in the US led to $28 billion in product sales and 965 new products from licensed university work (AUTM). Each of the top 15 institutions collected at least $100 million; some over $400 million. Valuation strategies used in the licensing process have important implications for universities and their prospective licensing partners. A school's financial and IP-related objectives color the innovation portfolio, as well as the willingness of external enterprises to license innovations. Medical schools offer particular opportunities to improve the world's standard of living, and this study focuses on methods used to establish a priori value for their university-sponsored research. Technology licensing offices in US institutions were interviewed. Overall, about one-third of the respondents' technology is licensed; respondents represent about 40% of all licensing revenue reported by AUTM. Generally, about one-half of the medical institutions estimate the value of their IP prior to licensing, primarily via comparison with comparable technologies. About 50% consider non-financial metrics in the process: noting both the value to society and the nature of the technology, per se.

Whilst several papers in current literature discuss performance assessments in innovation contexts, less research specifically addresses the issue of performance measurement for TI. This paper aims to start to fill this gap by developing empirical evidence about the current evaluation methods adopted in industry, and the challenges posed by the metrics used in assessing TI. A framework is proposed, which suggests that the metrics used for TI follow two logics: The first is that they are activity- or outcome-based, and the second is that they apply either to specific projects or to the entire firm. This classification of metrics could help practitioners structure their future measuring and evaluating strategies. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","assessment; decision-making; effectiveness; efficiency; evaluation; information quality; innovation management measurement; metrics; open innovation; performance measure; technology intelligence; technology scouting","Efficiency; Quality control; assessment; effectiveness; evaluation; Information quality; Innovation management; metrics; Open innovation; Performance measure; Technology intelligence; Technology scouting; Decision making","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026755318"

The purpose of this paper is to explore three issues: understanding of the term “innovation”, innovation practice(s) and how innovation can be effectively measured. Design/methodology/approach – The 12 case studies presented in this paper involve micro enterprises based in Ireland. Data collected during depth interviews provide insights into understanding, practices, motivations, behaviours and attitudes relating to innovation. Findings – Although awareness of innovation theories, processes and procedures is found to be low, all of the micro enterprises studied engage in a range of innovation activities across products, processes, people and marketing. Innovation is important to the development of the enterprises; however, innovation is not a managed or systematic process, and this is often due to lack of resources. Practical implications – This paper presents six recommendations which are of use to academics, micro enterprises and government support agencies. These recommendations include making changes to the service provided by support agencies, simplifying innovation, developing an innovation brokering facility, and improving the design/delivery of innovation programmes.

In this opinion article, I explore the parallel view that we should take a collective stance on making the dissemination of scientific data fair in the conventional sense, by being mindful of equity and justice for patients, clinicians, academics, publishers, funders and academic institutions. The views I represent are founded on oral and written dialogue with clinicians, academics and the publishing industry.

This study empirically investigates the main and interaction effects of two of Hofstede's cultural metrics on firm innovation in small and medium enterprises in Egypt. The results from a survey of 326 respondents in small and medium enterprises in Egypt reveal that though the main effects of collectivism and assertiveness are not statistically significant as expected from extant literature, the interaction effect between the two is strong and statistically significant. Results are justified through the resonance effect that stems from two weak forces. Further implications of the findings are discussed.

The Collaborative Payer Provider Model (CPPM) addresses this challenge by reinventing the role of the payer into a full-service collaborative ally of the physician. From 2010 through 2014, a Medicare Advantage plan prospectively deployed the CPPM, averaging 30,561 members with costs that were 73.6% of fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare (p < 0.001). The health plan was not part of an integrated delivery system. After allocating $80 per member per month (PMPM) for primary care costs, the health plan had medical cost ratios averaging 75.1% before surplus distribution. Member benefits were the best in the market. The health plan was rated 4.5 Stars by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for years 1–4, and 5 Stars in study year 5 for quality, patient experience, access to care, and care process metrics. Primary care and specialist satisfaction were significantly better than national benchmarks. Savings resulted from shifts in spending from inpatient to outpatient settings, and from specialists to primary care physicians when appropriate. The CPPM is a scalable model that enables a win-win-win system for patients, providers, and payers. © 2017 by the authors.

We develop a robust and efficient measure of design outcome innovation and validate our measure with a large and diverse set of design outcomes from a project-based design class. The measure is based on expert judgments of design concepts' value and functionality derived from a set of importance-weighted design requirements. In the context of an engineering design class, the innovation score was a statistically significant predictor of success in terms of implementation status by the client. Thus, the measure's validity was supported by its ability to predict design concepts' implementation by clients in the context of a product realization class.

The main aim of SQA is to include methodologies and activities by testing the software at regular intervals to check its functionality and quality. These tests are performed throughout the development phase and not just at the end to keep the quality up to the mark. SQA is advancing at a fast pace globally among countries such as Australia, Germany, America, Malaysia, Japan etc.; however, developing countries like Pakistan seem to struggle with the idea of advancement and progress in the field of SQA.

The widely accepted triple helix and systems of innovation models show changing and overlapping roles of academic, industrial and governmental actors. In previous innovation systems, universities were not focused on applied research and technology transfer as much as they are now. Current literature shows a changing role of universities and importance of their involvement in innovation systems. Although academic organizations' roles have changed in innovation systems, academic performance measurement systems (APMS) are not adapted to examine innovation related performance factors. Many APMS focus on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as; publications, research projects and patents. However, the new APMS needs to assess the activities and processes that are related to innovation, such as; technology transfer processes, collaborative innovation activities, consultancies and academic spin-offs. For this study a new APMS is applied according to the needs of universities by using a synthetic data based on an engineering department's KPIs. APMS scores are calculated based on the cumulative metric of all research and innovation activities and, weighted according to the needs and considerations of the university. The results of this study show that many of those academicians who have great performance in publications and academic research do not necessarily have high-level performance in innovative activities. In fact the results show that those who had high points in some measurements have very low performance in others. For the management point of view, it may be more effective to position academicians for different roles and assess their performance accordingly as innovation-targeted, teaching-targeted and research-targeted academicians. © 2016 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology, Inc.","","Benchmarking; Education; Patents and inventions; Societies and institutions; Supply chain management; Technology transfer; Academic performance; Collaborative innovation; Engineering department; Innovation activity; Innovative activities; Key performance indicators; Performance factors; Performance measurements; Innovation","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016199845"

Methods: We organized a Bio-Innovation Symposium at Taiwan National University, before which participants (68) from Taipei and other regions responded to an English/Chinese survey with views on how to implement POCT. We analyzed Hualien County geospatially and compared geometrics with/without POCT. Results: Multidisciplinary respondents (34%, 23/68) suggested medical technologists be coordinators responsible for device management, education/ training, communications across departments, preparation/maintenance of compliance documents, and performance assurance; 93% suggested P&G cover highly infectious diseases (Ebola,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and Zika); and 81% agreed POCT-equipped isolation laboratories are necessary. Ranked priorities for POCTwere acute myocardial infarction (34%), infectious diseases (22%), diabetes (21%), acute heart failure (13%), and blood gas/electrolytes (9%). Most (75%) suggested P&G be integrated, created by both local and national agencies (52%). Reliability (29%) and device management (18%) were top priorities. Most (71%) said hospitals should select instruments, whereas medical technologists administrate (59%) and perform (50%) POCT. Conclusions: Bio-innovators are enthusiastically creating POC technologies in Taiwan, including low marginal cost assay modules capable of transforming public health paradigms. Geospatial analysis showed that POCT can speed acute response in rural areas of Hualien County. At a national convocation of the Taiwan Association ofMedical Technologists, P&G receptivity and support were strong, suggesting Taiwan will publish national POCT P&G.

Specifically, the mediating role of perceived quality in this relationship is explained using signaling theory. Design/methodology/approach – The conceptual model was tested in two empirical studies for three global consumer electronics brands in two product categories. Data were collected using a mall-intercept approach from consumers at a major shopping precinct in a metropolitan city. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings – The results provide compelling evidence for the proposed mediation relationship. Study 1 shows that perceived quality fully transmits the impact of brand innovativeness on to brand loyalty. Study 2 confirms this mediation relationship. Practical implications – The results can help product managers in their brand management and promotion of new products. Originality/value – Emerging research on consumer-level effects of innovativeness provides conflicting advice regarding how consumers’ perceptions of brand innovativeness affect intangible assets such as loyalty toward the brand. The present research reconciles contradictory findings in the literature by uncovering a different route through which consumer perceptions of brand innovativeness affect a key brand performance metric: brand loyalty. Specifically, the present study fills an important knowledge gap in the innovativeness literature and deepens our understanding of the relationship between brand innovativeness and brand loyalty by empirically examining and confirming the role of a hereto overlooked intervening variable, perceived quality. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand equity; Brand innovativeness; Brand loyalty; Customer satisfaction; Innovation; Perceived quality","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84966746607"

Growth in China was expected to slow to 6.3 percent in 2016 and 6.0 percent in 2017, primarily reflecting weaker investment growth as the economy continued to rebalance. Acknowledging that lower growth rates have become the ""new normal"", the Chinese leadership set the annual target growth rate for China at no less than 6.5 percent in its 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020). The Plan redefined China's development paradigm, de-emphasizing speed in favor of quality based on innovation, coordination, green development, openness and sharing. This vision constituted the foundation of China's concept and priorities for the G20 presidency. The article reviews the main outcomes of the Chinese G20 presidency, focusing on major results which reflect China's priorities for domestic development and international cooperation. Using qualitative and quantitative analysis of the G20 2016 documents and the documents of international organizations, the author highlights the key decisions made at the Hangzhou summit and trends in G20 engagement with international institutions. The findings indicate that the Chinese presidency's priorities of development, innovation and trade received unprecedented attention, with development reaching an almost 43% share in the discourse (compared to the average of 15% for the eleven summits), innovation rising tenfold to about 7% (compared to 0.75% for the eleven summits) and trade peaking to 7.3% (compared to the average rate of 2.8%). At 2.2%, the share of the G20 discourse dedicated to the environment was higher than the overall average (1.42%) and higher than at any other summit except Cannes and Los Cabos. While energy issue-related discourse (about 4%) ranked lower than for Brisbane and Antalya, the metric was comparable to the average for the period (3.4%). Discussion dedicated to economic issues (25%) was close to the average for the period (27%). In line with the historical trend, the share of finance issues in the G20 discourse continued to decline, reflecting the G20's role in the division of labor with regards to the regulation of financial markets. The intensity of G20 engagement with international organizations was higher than the average since the Washington summit. The choice of organizations was defined by the presidency's priorities and established trends. Given the UN's role in setting Sustainable Development Goals, and China's commitment to the UN as the central element of a fair and peaceful multilateral system, it came as no surprise that the intensity of references to the UN was twice as high as the average for G20 summits and significantly higher than in any other summit. A similar trend was observed with respect to the WTO and UNCTAD. The G20's reliance on OECD expertise continued to rise. The intensity of G20 engagement with the IMF and the World Bank was slightly lower than during the previous presidencies. Last but not least, China consolidated the G20's dialogue with engagement groups, most notably with B20 and L20. Drawing on the results of qualitative and quantitative analysis, the author concludes that China's G20 presidency contributed to the country's development priorities, reflected China's role in the evolving world order, and consolidated the G20's status as the premier forum for economic cooperation and making globalization work for everyone. The author asserts that China managed to ensure its imprint on future G20 cooperation. First, it did so by integrating innovation, the new industrial revolution and the digital economy into its core agenda, generating 137 commitments to innovative growth and setting up the relevant international mechanisms. Second, with respect to trade and investment, it facilitated development and the adoption of two documents defining guiding principles for global investment policymaking, and promoting inclusive trade and global value chains. Third, under China's stewardship, the G20 agreed to three action plans on energy cooperation, including Enhancing Energy Access in Asia and the Pacific: Key Challenges and G20 Voluntary Collaboration Action Plan, the G20 Voluntary Action Plan on Renewable Energy, and the G20 Energy Efficiency Leading Program (EELP), making further progress to address energy access, a cleaner energy future, energy efficiency, global energy architecture, energy security, as well as market transparency.

We advance and complement this important field of energy research through an innovative methodology that characterises the energy consumption of domestic life by making the linkages between appliance end-use and activities through an ontology built from qualitative data about the household and NILM data. We use activities as a descriptive term for the common ways households spend their time at home. These activities, such as cooking or laundering, are meaningful to households’ own lived experience. Thus, besides strictly technical algorithmic approaches for processing quantitative smart meter data, we also draw on social science time use approaches and interview and ethnography data. Our method disaggregates a households total electricity load down to appliance level and provides the start time, duration, and total electricity consumption for each occurrence of appliance usage. We then make inferences about activities occurring in the home by combining these disaggregated data with an ontology that formally specifies the relationships between electricity-using appliances and activities. We also propose two novel standardised metrics to enable easy quantifiable comparison within and across households of the energy intensity and routine of activities of interest. Finally, we demonstrate our results over a sample of ten households with an in-depth analysis of which activities can be inferred with the qualitative and quantitative data available for each household at any time, and the level of accuracy with which each activity can be inferred, unique to each household. This work has important applications from providing meaningful energy feedback to households to comparing the energy efficiency of households’ daily activities, and exploring the potential to shift the timing of activities for demand management. © 2016 The Author(s)","Activity recognition; Energy disaggregation; Energy efficiency metrics; Energy intensity; Time-use statistics","Domestic appliances; Electric load management; Electric power utilization; Energy utilization; Equipment; Smart meters; Activity recognition; Disaggregation; Energy efficiency metrics; Energy intensity; Time use; accuracy assessment; activity pattern; algorithm; demand-side management; energy efficiency; household energy; innovation; monitoring system; qualitative analysis; Energy efficiency","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84990947004"

Hybrid services involve service deliveries through conventional and technology-enabled environments, each of which is complementary and non-interchangeable. However, limited research has examined consumer behavior in response to a series of relevant service episodes in different channels at different points in time. In other words, how customers perceive service quality at each service encounter and how the cumulative effect of these perceptions influences customers’ overall service value assessment and satisfaction remain unclear. This study addresses this research gap by investigating the sequential influence of e-service quality on in-person service quality in a hybrid service format in which interpersonal and computer-mediated services coexist but at different points in time. Empirical analysis shows that e-service quality directly and positively affects in-person service quality, which fully mediates the effects of e-service quality on perceived value and customer satisfaction. The sequence of service encounters matters because in-person service quality perception has a stronger effect than e-service quality on customer metrics. Cumulative quality perceptions significantly influence perceived value and overall customer satisfaction.

It also aims to examine the learning organisation (LO) attributes associated with this initiative. Design/methodology/approach: This is a longitudinal case study based on interviews and reflective analysis, and reviewed using three “models” drawn from the literature: breaking the “iron triangle” (containing costs; widening access; enhancing quality); a tailored version of distance education appropriate for research-intensive universities; a strategy for successful adoption of disruptive technologies in higher education. Findings: Entrepreneurialism yielded growth (PLE student numbers went from 150 to 2,000 in 15 years) and diversification (two new programmes established). The PLE programme advanced in two “waves”: the first centred on widening access and the second, on enhancing quality. Costs were contained. Both the presence and absence of LO attributes are identified at three different organisational levels. Research limitations/implications: Challenges to academic identity may act to inhibit educational change, especially in research-strong settings. Practical/implications: Business logic, and the creation and institutionalisation of educational development support – an “internal networking” group, were keys to success. “Organisational learning” in complex institutional environments such as universities involves understandably lengthy timescales (e.g. decades or more). Practical/implications: Technology-enabled disruption in higher education appears relentless. While institutional and individual performance metrics favour research, proven cases of “how to do things differently” in education may well not get exploited, thus opening the market to alternative providers. Originality/value: This is the only empirical example of a tailored version of distance education appropriate for research-intensive universities that we know about. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Digital disruption; Distance learning; Entrepreneurial universities; Innovation; Practical legal education; Shared leadership","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032201881"

The education sector, considered as one of the leading sectors in terms of innovation through technology, is also facing a transformation in which digital technology is rapidly evolving. In this context, the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) phenomenon has gained a lot of attraction due to the capability of reaching thousands or even millions of students from all over the world. However, the activities related to MOOCs are not yet being evaluated or quantified as a driver of change. Since the creation of MOOCs requires support and institutional commitment to deliver high-quality courses on technology-based platforms, it seems reasonable to measure the degree of innovation in education through the definition of an indicator that collects the commitment of an institution or a person to this new environment of digital education. That is why, in this paper, authors present the definition of a novel indicator and several potential metrics to represent and quantify the degree of innovation in education in universities.

To solve this problem, we propose a method of identification of unknown elf-ffles based on the metric classification algorithms. The method consists of three stages. On the first stage the preparation of the training sample by the disassembly of each file and submitting it in the form of an ordered set of the 118 elements is implemented. Each of these elements is the frequency of occurrences of the 118 most commonly used commands in the assembler code. Each program in the sample is represented by several sets, corresponding to different versions or operating systems in which this software is installed. Then, the Minkowski metric of each sample file and identifiable file is calculated. For the method of potential functions the selection of the reference elements of each set is obtained. On the third stage using the metric classification algorithms we evaluate affiliation of the identifiable file for a particular program from the sample. To approbate proposed method the experiment with the use of this method was conducted; results showing the accuracy of identification of elf-files was equal to 89,60% were obtained. The results indicate that this method is applicable in problems of identification of elf-files while conducting the internal audit of computer equipment. The advantages of the method are the accuracy of program identification regardless of the elf-files versions in the Linux operating systems. The ease of implementation of our method and the identification execution speed can be used not only in tasks of internal audit, but also in other tasks of computer forensics. © 2016 FRUCT.","","Computer forensics; Computer operating systems; Innovation; Security of data; Classification algorithm; Computer equipments; Execution speed; LINUX- operating system; Method of identifications; Minkowski metric; Potential function; Training sample; Problem solving","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84989181085"

However, finding useful analogies in these large, messy, real-world repositories remains a persistent challenge for either human or automated methods. Previous approaches include costly hand-created databases that have high relational structure (e.g., predicate calculus representations) but are very sparse. Simpler machine-learning/information-retrieval similarity metrics can scale to large, natural-language datasets, but struggle to account for structural similarity, which is central to analogy. In this paper we explore the viability and value of learning simpler structural representations, specifically, ""problem schemas"", which specify the purpose of a product and the mechanisms by which it achieves that purpose. Our approach combines crowdsourcing and recurrent neural networks to extract purpose and mechanism vector representations from product descriptions. We demonstrate that these learned vectors allow us to find analogies with higher precision and recall than traditional information-retrieval methods. In an ideation experiment, analogies retrieved by our models significantly increased people's likelihood of generating creative ideas compared to analogies retrieved by traditional methods. Our results suggest a promising approach to enabling computational analogy at scale is to learn and leverage weaker structural representations. © 2017 ACM.","Computational analogy; Creativity; Innovation; Product dimensions; Text embedding; Text mining","Calculations; Encoding (symbols); Innovation; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Patents and inventions; Recurrent neural networks; Computational analogy; Creativity; Product dimensions; Text embedding; Text mining; Data mining","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029104981"

With the almost global availability of the Internet comes the expectation of universal accessibility to knowledge, including scientific knowledge-particularly that generated by public funding. Currently this is not the case. In this Commentary we discuss access to this knowledge, the politics that govern peer review and publication, and the role of this knowledge as a public good in medicine.  Gutenberg's invention of the printing press in 1440 opened an avenue for the distribution of scholarly information to the entire world. The scientific literature first appeared in 1665 with Le Journal des Sçavans followed in the same year by Philosophical Transactions. Today there are more than 5000 scientific publishing companies, 25,000 journals and 1.5 million articles published/year generating revenue of $25 billion USD.  The European Union and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have argued for open access (OA) to scientific data for all publicly funded research by 2020 with a similar initiative in the USA via the Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act (FASTR). However, OA to published science is but one step in this odyssey. If the products of science are not openly available then it can be argued that the norms of science as defined by Merton including “universalism” and “communalism” have yet to be accomplished. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the delivery of medicines to the poor and for rare diseases, the attempts to privatize human genetic information and, not least, dealing with the challenges of antibiotic resistance and new disease pandemics exacerbated by climate change.

As the global population expands, there is an inevitable increase in competition for vital resources. The interaction of these resources—namely, food-energy-water—is referred to as the FEW Nexus. Water is the key resource that is in limited supply, and as the demand grows for energy and food dependent on it, so does global inequality and suffering. It is only through technical and socially aware innovations that these allocation issues can be addressed. Universal metrics, though flawed, are needed to help compare and contrast new FEW Nexus projects and technologies for those that need to plan and implement interventions to improve access to these vital resources. Social stickiness, or society’s willingness and ability to adopt and apply FEW Nexus interventions, is a vital component of these universal metrics. Social stickiness measures the ability of innovations to be successfully transferred from “science lab” to “social life” in order to educate and improve the global quality of existence through widespread and educated user adoption. Existing FEW program/technology metrics usually define an output per unit input (e.g., kWh/m3) and are limited to two areas the FEW Nexus with an obvious, but undefined association to the third (e.g., less water for agriculture). All technical metrics appear to treat the FEW Nexus as a static problem with no social or cultural context. Consequently, universal metrics should include a social measure of the target population as well as the traditional output/input measurements. The United Nations’ inequality-adjusted human development index (IHDI) could be a way to quickly include a social component to assess an innovation’s usability and improvement in the global community. The FEW needs and constraints found in developed and developing countries vary drastically, meaning that any universal metric that is created will not account for the complexity of the international situation, but would still be a useful tool to compare and contrast different innovations for local non-experts seeking to implement them. © 2016, AESS.","Food-energy-water; Innovation; Metrics; Nexus; Social stickiness","community resource management; econometrics; energy resource; food science; global perspective; human development index; innovation; technological change; United Nations; water resource","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84977111516"

The scope of the innovation management has evolved. It includes more than creating new products or services but also the creation of new businesses and new markets. This competitive scenario suggests the development of a structure to support the innovation process and metrics to evaluate it. Adding to this the relevance of customer-centered orientation and the peculiarities associated with the Brazilian electric power sector, this paper aims to propose an innovation management system supported by performance drivers. The innovation management system and the performance drivers were developed based on the: (I) literature review; (II) benchmarking analysis of companies that had innovation in their DNA; (III) existing innovation process of the electric power company; and (IV) interview with innovation experts. The system also allows a quantitative evaluation of ideas selection and projects implementation. As a result, the innovation management system aims to reinforce/develop: (I) transparency in the innovation decision-making process, (II) innovation culture, by employees' creative thinking, (III) strategic business alignment on projects, (IV) risk reduction on projects financial investments, and (V) profit leverage by new creative solutions to the electric power market.

In this paper, we focus on the duality between what is successful and what is significant in the musical context. To this end, we consider a user-generated set of tags collected through an online music platform, whose evolving co-occurrence network mirrors the growing conceptual space underlying music production. We define a set of general metrics aiming at characterizing music albums throughout history, and their relationships with the overall musical production. We show how these metrics allow to classify albums according to their current popularity or their belonging to expert-made lists of important albums. In this way, we provide the scientific community and the public at large with quantitative tools to tell apart popular albums from culturally or aesthetically relevant artworks.

There are two pathways for achieving compliance with the NCC's mandatory performance requirements; (i) developing a performance solution, or (ii) following a prescriptive solution. Typically, performance solutions are unique designs proposed as achieving compliance with respective performance requirements; whereas prescriptive solutions are generic solutions deemed by regulators as complying with respective performance requirements. A recent study has identified that there is a potential productivity gain of $1.1bn by increasing the use of performance solutions within the Australian building and plumbing industry [1]. While the NCC has been a performance-based code since 1996, there is still a reliance on prescriptive solutions as it has been difficult to quantify performance requirements [2]. This has resulted in designers and practitioners not being confident in using some performance requirements, such as those for energy efficiency. The Australian Building Codes Board (ABCB) is currently undertaking a project to help increase the use of performance solutions, including in the area of energy efficiency, through quantifying the performance requirements, changing culture, building capacity and removing potential impediments within the industry. This includes looking at appropriate metrics, the use of verification methods, engaging with regulators to improve the tools they use for handling performance solutions and developing educational materials aimed at both residential and commercial building practitioners. The aim of this work is to help increase productivity and innovation within the building industry through enabling the development of tailored innovative performance solutions, and in the case of energy efficiency, aligning methodologies with best-practice voluntary sustainability schemes as appropriate. This paper describes how the NCC facilitates innovation within the building industry in relation to energy efficiency and sustainability performance. © 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","building; code; energy efficiency; performance; performance-based; quantification; regulation; sustainability","Building codes; Buildings; Construction; Construction industry; Materials handling; Office buildings; Plumbing; Productivity; Regulatory compliance; Sustainable development; Codes (symbols); Energy efficiency; code; performance; Performance based; quantification; regulation; Energy efficiency; Innovation","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020548952"

This paper extends prior research (Hatzikian 2013a, b) and the main question of this study is, “What was the most effective innovation intensity that a firm needs to have for its firm performance before the Greek debt Crisis?” To this end, we use productivity and knowledge production or growth as metrics of firm performance and we explore their behaviour with regard to a firm’s innovation intensity. We test the hypotheses that there is a U-shaped relationship between innovation intensity and productivity, and there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between innovation intensity and knowledge production in the short-term period. We apply the method for examining nonlinearities, that is, the introduction of squared terms as independent variables. The collected variables are used in a multivariate multiple regression model formulation to evaluate the relative performance associated with them. For this reason, a number of variables are used, like the innovation intensity, the squared term of innovation intensity, the research and development (R&D) personnel, as well as the firm size.

We use Malmquist productivity index (MPI) as the performance metric and stochastic production frontier (SPF) as the measurement approach. We then decompose MPI into two ingredient components that represent technological change for innovation capability and efficiency change for catch-up effort. It is found that the IT service industries display an impressive annual rate of 7.4% for productivity growth during the study period. The parametric decomposition of MPI unveils that almost all of the productivity growth observed is enabled by technological advance made to the production process by IT service providers while efficiency change has little effect. Moreover, each country×s IT service industry demonstrates a distinctive pattern relating to the three measures of productivity growth, technological change, and efficiency change. This observation suggests that each country×s IT service industry possesses certain strengths that become the sources of its competitive advantage, and there are weaknesses that could be targets for performance improvement. Based on our empirical results, we offer practical implications and identify future research topics for performance evaluation of IT service and other industries. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

By discussing the challenges and opportunities faced by Data.gov, we provide several lessons that can inform research and practice. We suggest that providing access to open data in itself does not spur innovation. Specifically, we claim that public agencies need to spend resources to improve the capacities of their organizations to move toward 'open data by default'; develop capacities of community to use data to solve problems; and think critically about the unintended consequences of providing access to public data. We also suggest that public agencies need better metrics to evaluate the success of open-data efforts in achieving its goals. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

One specific way to do this is to create brand fanpages on social networking sites. Companies can publish brand posts (containing images, texts, videos, information, and other contents) on their respective brand fanpages. Consumers can become users of these brand fanpages by becoming a fan, and consequently mark that they like the brand post or leave comments. These actions and comments help spread brand information. Liking or sharing brand posts enhances the fanpage's viral reach. Marketers determine the effectiveness of social media marketing policies by measuring viral reach. In this article, we determine possible drivers for users' viral actions. We collected contents on all types of brand posts and selected the most frequently posted items (contents) to determine their respective impacts on producing user engagement action (viral reach). We analyzed 1950 brand posts from 13 international Electronics brands, and the data was collected from December 2015 to August 2016. The findings indicated that different drivers influence the number of comments, likes, and the number of shares differently. Managers of brands that operate brand fanpages can be guided by our results to determine which content to publish at brand posts based on their requirements. Moreover, the types of contents that are posted frequently in fanpages can be explored, which will be helpful for B2C (Business to consumer) marketers.","Fanpages; Social media marketing; Social media metrics analysis; Viral metrics","Commerce; Economics; Information management; Innovation; Marketing; Regional planning; Sustainable development; Business to Consumer; Fanpages; Measurement tools; Social media; Social media marketings; Social networking sites; User engagement; Viral metrics; Social networking (online)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029747859"

Methods This work extends previous studies by examining the association between the growth of research on drug targets and approval of NMEs associated with these targets. Drawing on research on innovation in other technology sectors, where technological maturity is an important determinant in the success or failure of new product development, an analytical model was used to characterize the growth of research related to the known targets for all 168 approved cardiovascular therapeutics. Findings Categorizing and mapping the technological maturity of cardiovascular therapeutics reveal that (1) there has been a distinct transition from phenotypic to targeted methods for drug discovery, (2) the durations of clinical and regulatory processes were significantly influenced by changes in FDA practice, and (3) the longest phase of the translational process was the time required for technology to advance from initiation of research to a statistically defined established point of technology maturation (mean, 30.8 years).

Product ideas are evaluated as scientific hypotheses, and tested in web sites, mobile applications, desktop applications, services, and operating systems. One of the key challenges for organizations that run controlled experiments is to come up with the right set of metrics [1] [2] [3]. Having good metrics, however, is not enough. In our experience of running thousands of experiments with many teams across Microsoft, we observed again and again how incorrect interpretations of metric movements may lead to wrong conclusions about the experiment's outcome, which if deployed could hurt the business by millions of dollars. Inspired by Steven Goodman's twelve p-value misconceptions [4], in this paper, we share twelve common metric interpretation pitfalls which we observed repeatedly in our experiments. We illustrate each pitfall with a puzzling example from a real experiment, and describe processes, metric design principles, and guidelines that can be used to detect and avoid the pitfall. With this paper, we aim to increase the experimenters' awareness of metric interpretation issues, leading to improved quality and trustworthiness of experiment results and better data-driven decisions. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).","A/B testing; Controlled experiments; Metrics; Online experiments","Data mining; A/b testing; Controlled experiment; Data driven decision; Desktop applications; Metrics; On-line experiments; Online controlled experiments; Scientific Hypothesis; Software testing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029038813"

Facility location analysis has traditionally been driven by access to feedstock, proximity to customers, and local incentives. While economic constraints will always be major factors in site selection, incorporating social metrics may further reduce the cost of constructing a biorefinery. A community's disposition toward a biorefinery project may significantly impact implementation success: grassroots support can lower implementation costs while opposition may increase the costs of permitting blockages and other scale-up delays. The proposed biorefinery siting tool improves upon previous research by incorporating site-specific biogeophysical measures and more complete and comprehensive social measures of community innovation and capacity for collective action. A refined biogeophysical analysis assesses pulp mills for their potential as repurposed biorefineries. The social asset components of site selection are greatly improved by enhancing and disaggregating key metrics through the use of multiple indicators of community collective action capacity and propensity for change. The refined measures are integrated into a biorefinery site-selection tool. Pulp mills that rank highly in both the biogeophysical and social asset measures may be considered more suitable candidates for repurpose into a biorefinery.

Arthroplasty surgery potentially represents an area with highly innovative process. This study highlights key area of innovation in knee arthroplasty over the past 35 years using patent and publication metrics. Growth rates and patterns are analyzed. Patents are correlated to publications as a measure of scientific support. Methods: Electronic patent and publication databases were searched over the interval 1980-2014 for ""knee arthroplasty"" OR ""knee replacement."" The resulting patent codes were allocated into technology clusters. Citation analysis was performed to identify any important developments missed on initial analysis. The technology clusters identified were further analyzed, individual repeat searches performed, and growth curves plotted. Results: The initial search revealed 3574 patents and 16,552 publications. The largest technology clusters identified were Unicompartmental, Patient-Specific Instrumentation (PSI), Navigation, and Robotic knee arthroplasties. The growth in patent activity correlated strongly with publication activity (Pearson correlation value 0.892, P < .01), but was growing at a faster rate suggesting a decline in vigilance. PSI, objectively the fastest growing technology in the last 5 years, is currently in a period of exponential growth that began a decade ago.

An additional trigger may be genome-wide hybridization resulting from “hybrid swarm.” However, these hypotheses have been difficult to test due to the rarity of comparable control environments lacking adaptive radiations. Here I exploit such a pattern in microendemic radiations of Caribbean pupfishes. I show that a sympatric three species radiation on San Salvador Island, Bahamas diversified 1445 times faster than neighboring islands in jaw length due to the evolution of a novel scale-eating adaptive zone from a generalist ancestral niche. I then sampled 22 generalist populations on seven neighboring islands and measured morphological diversity, stomach content diversity, dietary isotopic diversity, genetic diversity, lake/island areas, macroalgae richness, and Caribbean-wide patterns of gene flow. None of these standard metrics of ecological opportunity or gene flow were associated with adaptive radiation, except for slight increases in macroalgae richness. Thus, exceptional trophic diversification is highly localized despite myriad generalist populations in comparable environmental and genetic backgrounds. This study provides a strong counterexample to the ecological and hybrid swarm theories of adaptive radiation and suggests that diversification of novel specialists on a sparse fitness landscape is constrained by more than ecological opportunity and gene flow. © 2016 The Author(s).

External factors such as market pressure through liberalization, de-carbonization and decentralization challenge established actors in the industry. Answers to these challenges cannot be found by single actors but require networks to gather and concentrate innovation activities. This implies a need for knowledge transfer among energy providers. The authors aim at exploring knowledge exchange relations in-depth by treating them as multidimensional flows which can comprise technological, market, managerial or regulatory knowledge. In detail, the authors examine patterns of knowledge exchange on network-, dyad- and firm-level. Furthermore, first, empiric results are provided on how two of these patterns, namely, a firm’s propensity to form multiplex instead of uniplex ties as well as the composition of externally acquired knowledge concerning the four types, influence organizational innovativeness. Design/methodology/approach: The authors address their research questions by conducting an in-depth investigation of the largest network of municipal utilities in Germany. The analysis is based on quantitative data collected via standardized online questionnaires drawing on socio-metric methods to reconstruct knowledge exchange networks as well as traditional approaches from socio-empiric research to evaluate firm innovativeness. Findings: The findings indicate that while technological, market, managerial and regulatory knowledge represent different types of knowledge with different exchange patterns, these transfers are interdependent. In particular, the analysis reveals non-hierarchical relations of complementarity. The authors furthermore provide evidence for the existence of ideal profiles for attaining different types of innovation. One central tendency across all of these profiles is that outperformers acquire regulatory knowledge to a significantly lesser degree than other firms and focus more on the other types instead. Research limitations/implications: This paper solely focusses on the largest network of municipal utilities whereby it is questionable how representative it is for the whole industry. Additionally, due to the cross-sectional design, the paper cannot fully rule out issues of endogeneity in the quantitative analysis. Practical implications: This paper delivers valuable insights for managers in the energy sector who seek to either enter and manage inter-organizational networks or apply external knowledge to foster innovation. In particular, the authors reveal benchmark profiles for external knowledge acquisition which may serve as templates for strategic collaboration and innovation management. Originality/value: To the authors’ knowledge, this paper presents the first innovation-related network analysis in the energy industry. Rather than operationalizing knowledge transfer as a simplex flow relation, the authors examine different types of knowledge, their patterns of exchange and their distinct effects on process, product and administrative innovations. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","German energy industry; Innovation; Innovation networks; Knowledge management; Knowledge transfer; Municipal utilities; Network analysis; Online surveys","Carbonization; Commerce; Electric network analysis; Information management; Innovation; Managers; Surveys; Energy industry; Innovation network; Knowledge transfer; Municipal utility; Online surveys; Knowledge management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021107352"

By redirecting harvest towards or away from particular length- or age-groups, length limits rely on harvest by anglers to maintain a population at or near a desired state. The fish population changes that follow the implementation of harvest regulations may take several years to manifest, so long-term monitoring may be needed to adequately evaluate length limits.We used an innovative application of cluster analysis to facilitate evaluation of the effects of three consecutive length limits on a population of Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides over a 28-year period in Ross Barnett Reservoir, Mississippi. A 13–16-in protected slot length limit (10 years), followed by a 15-in minimum length limit (MLL; 11 years), followed by a 12-in MLL (7 years) failed to restructure the Largemouth Bass population due to what we suggest was the expansion of a voluntary catch-and-release attitude that started in the first decade of the study period. Various population metrics shifted towards values expected in an unharvested population, and the observed shifts can be attributed to a harvest deficit created by the prevailing catch-and-release attitude. Largemouth Bass harvest regulations may no longer be relevant in many waters. The utility of regulations for restructuring Largemouth Bass populations is largely dependent on harvesting attitudes that vary geographically, depending on cultural characteristics and demographics. © American Fisheries Society 2017.","","Mississippi; United States; Micropterus; Micropterus salmoides; cluster analysis; demography; fishery management; harvesting; innovation; long-term change; monitoring; perciform; population density","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034607009"

It is achieved by inserting flow meters and gate valves into a network which has been previously clustered into subsystems. Generally, the procedures are subdivided into two main steps: the clustering and partitioning phases. At first, network nodes are assigned to each cluster and then the appropriate pipes are selected, in which flow meters or gate valves are to be inserted. In this paper, an improved multilevel-recursive bisection algorithm was used to achieve network clustering. To better allocate the hydraulic devices, the partitioning phase was carried out through the minimization of a novel, multi-objective function, taking simultaneous account of energy and economic aspects. The aim is to define a solution that occupies a minimum possible number of flow meters, simplifying the water budget computation, preserving the hydraulic performances, and minimizing the capital and the operational costs.

While the world has moved on from Bell Labs' famous advanced research model, visionary and farsighted technology-driven innovation is still vital to many of today's most successful global technology companies. Corporate innovation strategies are implemented through research laboratories, academic collaborations, advanced technology groups, standards groups, CTO office prototypes, internal/ external incubations, and open innovations. Unlike the well-understood nature of short-term product development, long time frames, fuzzily defined goals, and unclear measures of success lead to uncertainty of how to best run and fund advanced technology and applied corporate research. While all firms agree that advanced research is vital, their measures and processes differ widely. To identify modern models of effective advanced research approaches, the context in which such approaches are most effective, and the metrics by which they should be evaluated, we interviewed leaders at various successful and established global firms such as Cisco, Intel, Google, and others. We used the data collected to inductively arrive at six models that characterize modern advanced research approaches. The approaches of these models were different in the sense that some rely on academic and industry collaboration while others revolve around disrupting the status quo. The fact that the companies included in this study were successful means that all the models reflect a useful approach to advanced research. Therefore, no single model should be considered as better or ideal than the other. The models could be of use to a company trying to create an appropriate advanced research approach based on its goals and needs. Similarly, these models could help a company fine tune its existing RandD approach as its goals and identity develop over time. The models we present here provide useful terminology and will serve as backbone for further study of advanced development & corporate research approaches. © 2015 IEEE.","advanced development; corporate research; product and service development","Industrial management; Innovation; Research laboratories; advanced development; Advanced researches; Advanced technology; Advanced technology groups; Corporate innovation; Corporate research; Industry collaboration; Product and service development; Engineering research","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84968718783"

The programs are components of a broader agency leadership initiative focused on policies that promote a culture of open innovation and entrepreneurship aimed at improving workforce problem-solving capabilities and mission results. Data were collected and analyzed over a five-year period of employee experience in the two programs. The evaluations included surveys and structured interviews conducted among the participants of both programs. Longitudinally, the curation of data about the value of these programs to employees in their self-assessed ability to pursue and achieve institutional objectives supported iterative adjustments in program operations. Results were also benchmarked against data from the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, an annual organizational survey designed to elucidate attitudes among federal employees across a variety of topics, including innovation and empowerment. This report provides insights into the qualitative and quantitative parameters capable of being leveraged to maximize the design, measurement, and impact of innovationrelated programs and activities. The methods and data described herein represent a medium through which employee-based organizational perceptions about culture can be interrogated and examined. These findings also demonstrate the value of program assessment tools and data in guiding federal program leaders in institutional policymaking and selection of innovation methods to address distinct aspects of their organization's adaptive change towards a culture of innovation.","Entrepreneurship; Government; Metrics; Public sector innovation; Workforce","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018730660"

In such situations, decision makers all too often become risk averse and reliant on known metrics that are inherently based on deductive and inductive logics. In prior research, however, good decision making on innovation has been linked with the complementary use of another form of logic: Abductive reasoning. Abductive reasoning changes the mind-set of decision makers to become intrinsically forward thinking and explorative towards innovation opportunity. In this paper, we present an experimental study suggesting that the cognitive, creative capabilities of humans correlate positively with their use of abductive reasoning in decision making. We are further able to show that a higher level of abductive reasoning leads to significantly better, i.e. more accurate, decisions in selecting successful innovation concepts. These findings have strong implications for companies seeking to improve their innovative performance, specifically, how and by whom decisions on innovation should be made.","Abductive reasoning; Creativity; Decision making; Design thinking; Innovation","Innovation; Abductive reasoning; Creativity; Design thinking; Inductive logic; Innovation concepts; Innovative design; Innovative performance; Market potential; Decision making","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029739490"

Design/methodology/approach – Based on a sample of international agribusiness companies observed over a five-year period, this paper uses correlation and multiple regression analysis to test for the existence of a positive relationship between each IC component and conventional business performance metrics. Findings – The empirical results support the hypotheses that RC and PrC have a positive impact on corporate performance. Counter to the expectations, InnC by itself is negatively associated with performance. Results also failed to confirm the hypothesis that HC directly and positively affects performance. However HC positively moderates the relation between InnC and performance, which suggests that firms that heavily invest in HC are better placed to gain returns from their research and development (R&D) investments. Originality/value – This study expands the existing research on the link between IC and performance by adding fresh evidence from a highly knowledge-intensive sector which has been under-researched thus far. It may also contribute to the specific literature on R&D and performance as it uncovers that the value-generating effect associated with R&D investments is contingent on the levels of HC. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Agribusiness; Firm performance; Human capital; Innovation; Intellectual capital","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84977108822"

Although many metrics measuring the process of innovation and the performance of the enterprise have been developed, a fundamentally solid and complete metric speaking to the quality and viability of the innovative idea itself is lacking. The business, applied innovation, creativity, unmet user needs and problem-solving (BACUP) model of innovation quality is proposed as such a metric based on viewing innovation from the five different viewpoints mentioned in its definition. BACUP is shown to facilitate discussion and analysis in innovation theory and is proposed as a tool allowing any innovation governance structure to achieve innovation assurance by mitigating risk and uncertainty and maximizing an innovation's chance for success. Design/methodology/approach - The BACUP framework was inspired by researching definitions of innovation and coming upon asurveyinwhich different definitions were obtained from several different roles in companies and organizations. To use BACUP as a metric, the author and research assistants made qualitative judgments about innovations. Several judgments were obtained independently and consensus was plotted on the BACUP graphs. Findings - BACUP can be used to illustrate and discuss major concepts in innovation theory. BACUP can be used to compare the relative viability of different innovative ideas. BACUP can be used to detect vulnerabilities in innovative ideas and provide information to innovation management and governance so that corrective measures can be taken. BACUP can be extended by other researchers and practitioners. Research limitations/implications - In its current form, BACUP is not a quantitative tool; however, the authors envision other researchers applying existing quantitative tools and incorporating them into the BACUP framework. Practical implications - BACUP is an innovative idea quality metric employable in any existing innovation management/governance structure or methodology. BACUP also gives practitioners a way to engineer innovative ideas into successful innovations. Social implications - BACUP can lead to predictable and repeatable improved innovation outcomes, resulting in superior solutions to problems in all domains. Originality/value - The BACUP framework is a novel, multi-dimensional view of innovation. Application of BACUP as a metric yields a new type of capability for innovation governance called innovation assurance. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Idea quality; Innovation assurance; Innovation governance; Innovation management; Innovation quality","Problem solving; Risk assessment; Uncertainty analysis; Corrective measures; Design/methodology/approach; Governance structures; Innovation management; Innovation theory; Multi-dimensional view; Quantitative tool; Social implication; Innovation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018964848"

However, temporary streams and rivers are being degraded at alarming rates owing to development, hydromorphological alteration, and disposal of waste water, among other stressors, and pressure will likely increase under global change. Here we propose that it is key to manage temporary streams and rivers as a unique ecohydrological type and not as a permanent waterway or a terrestrial ecosystem. Nevertheless, two challenges hinder this goal. First, data availability on intermittent low regimes and associated biotas is currently scarce. As a consequence, flow-ecology relationships in temporary waterways are largely unknown, and appropriate metrics to define and monitor their ecological status are missing. Second, the ecological and social values of temporary streams and rivers are often underestimated, being regarded as secondary ecosystems relative to permanent waterways. To conserve temporary streams and rivers, ecologists need to define them as unique ecosystems and conservation targets, and practitioners need to systematically collect biological and hydrological data in these ecosystems. Innovative approaches at the intersection of ecology, citizen science, and management, can also contribute to their management and conservation by: i) mapping them, ii) informing people about their ecological values, iii) safeguarding them from further human threats, iv) preserving their flow regime when managing reservoirs, wastewater treatment plants, and water abstraction activities, and v) restoring physically-degraded temporary reaches (e.g. due to gravel mining and off-road use) or reaches that have lost historical flows due to increasing drought severity, diversions, and groundwater overuse. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Ecosystem management; Ecosystem services; Flow intermittency; Freshwater biodiversity conservation","biodiversity; conservation; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; environmental degradation; freshwater; global change; innovation; river; stream; water flow","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85031123245"

One barrier to interdisciplinary research is the widespread perception that interdisciplinary projects are less likely to be funded than those with a narrower focus. However, this commonly held belief has been difficult to evaluate objectively, partly because of lack of a comparable, quantitative measure of degree of interdisciplinarity that can be applied to funding application data. Here we compare the degree to which research proposals span disparate fields by using a biodiversity metric that captures the relative representation of different fields (balance) and their degree of difference (disparity). The Australian Research Council's Discovery Programme provides an ideal test case, because a single annual nationwide competitive grants scheme covers fundamental research in all disciplines, including arts, humanities and sciences. Using data on all 18,476 proposals submitted to the scheme over 5 consecutive years, including successful and unsuccessful applications, we show that the greater the degree of interdisciplinarity, the lower the probability of being funded. The negative impact of interdisciplinarity is significant even when number of collaborators, primary research field and type of institution are taken into account. This is the first broad-scale quantitative assessment of success rates of interdisciplinary research proposals. The interdisciplinary distance metric allows efficient evaluation of trends in research funding, and could be used to identify proposals that require assessment strategies appropriate to interdisciplinary research. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In particular, the authors critique whether actual learning outcomes can be profitably used to measure effectiveness; and consider how student performance can be evaluated through the twin lenses of implementation or innovation. Design/methodology/approach – The authors undertook a review of both traditional and experiential approaches to entrepreneurship education. In addition to comparing these approaches, the authors critiqued a number of “taken for granted” assumptions regarding the effectiveness of experiential approaches to entrepreneurship education and made recommendations. Findings – Although there is a large body of research on experiential approaches towards entrepreneurship education, the authors know little about how these approaches contribute towards the effective achievement of desired learning outcomes. Whilst many authors claim that such approaches are effective, such assertions are not supported by sufficient robust evidence. Hence the authors need to establish more effective student performance evaluation metrics. In particular: first, whether actual learning outcomes are appropriate measures of effectiveness; and second, the authors should evaluate student performance through the lenses of the two “Is” – implementation or innovation. Practical implications – Whether actual learning outcomes are used as a measure of effectiveness at all needs to be critiqued further. Implementation involves doing things that are determined by others and matching against their expectations, whereas innovation comprises producing multiple and varied solutions that respond to change and often surprise. Originality/value – Through revisiting the discussions on the art and the science of entrepreneurship education, this paper represents an initial critical attempt – as part of an ongoing study – to fill a gap in entrepreneurship education research. The paper, therefore, has significant value for students, entrepreneurship educators and policy-makers. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Effectiveness; Entrepreneurship education; experiential; Implementation; Innovation; Learning outcomes","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84952837382"

The prefix “eco-” refers to both economic and ecological (environmental) performance. The need for improving eco-efficiency leads to the challenge of identifying the most promising alternative solutions which improve both the economic and the environmental performance of a given system (“eco-innovations”). Therefore, it becomes critical to develop eco-efficiency metrics for measuring environmental and economic performance of a system. The current paper presents a methodological framework that attempts to explore the use of eco-efficiency indicators in meso-level water use systems and through them to assess the impact of innovative technologies in such systems. The assessment of the environmental performance follows a life cycle-oriented approach using the midpoint impact categories while the economic performance is measured using the total value added to the product due to water use. The eco-efficiency is expressed as the ratio of the economic performance indicator to the environmental performance indicator. The proposed approach is applied to a water use system of the agricultural sector, and more specifically to the fresh form tomato crop production in Phthiotida. The analysis reveals that the most important environmental impacts of the system are (a) greenhouse gas emissions due to energy consumption, (b) release of toxic substances, due to the use of fertilizers and pesticides, and (c) depletion of freshwater resources. Three alternative interventions are examined for upgrading the value chain: (a) installation of subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) system, (b) replacement of diesel pumps with solar pumps, and (c) use of organic fertilizers. Based on the findings, all of the proposed interventions have a positive impact on the overall eco-efficiency of the system. SDI is the least favorable mainly due to its high investment cost. The use of solar pumps strongly influences climate change and photochemical ozone formation while the use of organic fertilizers has a more balanced impact on all indicators, with an emphasis on eutrophication. Thus, for a more holistic approach, regarding the eco-efficiency performance, a combined application of these three scenarios may be proposed. © 2015 Balaban Desalination Publications.

Increasingly, the concept of resilience is being used to inform development initiatives aimed at building the capacity of rural households and communities to cope, adapt, and transform in the face of diverse shocks and stressors. There remain, however, significant challenges to mainstreaming resilience thinking into food and nutrition security policy and programming, primarily because the concept is best understood as being embedded within dynamic and highly contextual processes that can be interpreted differently by various parties. This Special Section of Food Security presents international case studies exploring the vulnerability of rural livelihoods and the initiatives proposed to build resilience, providing valuable insights into the practical challenges to assessing resilience in different contexts. Through different applications of the resilience concept, these case studies highlight the key roles played by broader social, institutional, and governance contexts in affecting food and nutrition security.

To date, the bulk of attention has been on the first part of this principle–CBDR–because of the importance of addressing responsibility. However, we propose that a more robust notion of RC is possible, useful and timely as countries are currently articulating their first Nationally Determined Contributions, a process that is expected to ratchet up over time under the new regime. We combine Sen and Nussbaum's notion of a ‘capabilities approach’ with the framework provided by the UNFCCC to identify five sub-elements of RC and propose metrics for each of them. These sub-elements are human development, economic capacity, resilience to climate impacts, governance capacity, and technical and innovation capacity. We are not proposing replacing discussions of responsibility with those of capabilities. Responsibility remains central to the climate equity discussion. However, differentiation based on responsibility alone may not be adequate to address climate impacts or human development needs, both of which are central to climate equity. Providing countries with a robust approach for articulating RC enhances the overall ability for the principle of CBDR-RC to address the trio of climate equity challenges posed by unequal climate impacts, development status, and responsibility. Moreover, including a more robust notion of capabilities in the operationalization of equity may identify additional means for supporting specific domestic climate policies able to address core development needs in the context of increased carbon constraints and climate impacts. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","capabilities; CBDR-RC; equity; UNFCCC","climate effect; economic analysis; environmental legislation; environmental policy; equity; governance approach; human development index; innovation; legislative implementation; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84969662814"

The academic entrepreneurial transition arises from the confluence of the internal development of higher education institutions and external influences on academic structures associated with the emergence of ‘knowledge-based’ innovation. Policies, practices and organizational innovations designed to translate knowledge into economic activity as well as addressing problems from society have spread globally. The objective is to enable universities to play a creative role in economic and social development from an independent perspective while still being responsive to government and industry priorities. The entrepreneurial university model paradoxically includes both increased university autonomy and greater involvement of external stakeholders. However, to facilitate the successful development of the entrepreneurial university, the dominant metrics used to determine university rankings and academic performance need radical revision.

This phenomenon, known as “convergence”, leads to emerging industry segments and offers a wide array of opportunities for synergies. Against this background, a significant emphasis has been put on anticipating technology convergence as well as identifying and understanding the changing innovation patterns and industry structure associated with convergence. The timely recognition of converging technological fields enables the innovating enterprises to exert a positive influence on the changing value-chain. This paper introduces a refined methodological approach for the anticipation of converging technology areas based on the concept of knowledge flow. The proposed method is illustrated using patents related to the areas of Nutraceuticals and Functional Food (NFF), Nanotechnology and Wearables. Our results indicate that the emerging technology convergence can be expressed by the concept of “weak signals”.

Through this articulation work of narrative construction innovators translated their perceived image of the audience into material properties of their artifact and weaved it into their narrative presentation.

Novel energy storage technologies are expected to make an important contribution in the future, particularly in the event of heat and transport electrification or if intermittent renewables and nuclear come to dominate electricity generation. Numerous energy storage technologies have been proposed to store excess electricity, with electrical energy conversion to mechanical, thermal, gravitational, electrochemical, and chemical energy for storage, and many of these technologies are classified in this chapter. Energy storage technologies are complicated and poorly understood relative to most low-carbon technologies. A series of metrics have been proposed to compare storage technologies, but understanding how to integrate energy storage into low-carbon energy systems remains a difficult challenge for several reasons. The value of storage to an energy system depends on the electricity generation portfolio, particularly the relative amounts of inflexible and flexible generation. Existing energy system, dispatch, and network models are either not broad enough to examine all energy storage and alternative options, or have insufficient temporal resolution to realistically portray the need for and performance of storage technologies. Innovation is required to reduce technology costs. There is a dearth of knowledge on public attitudes toward energy storage technologies. Finally, even if the long-term value of energy storage could be demonstrated, existing electricity markets are designed for incumbent systems and market regulation would need to be adapted to reflect the technological, economic, and social value of energy storage to an energy system. Further R&D and a better understanding of the integration of energy storage technologies are vital to provide information to underpin future market design and regulation to realize the value of energy storage. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Originality/gap/relevance/implications: Organizational slack and innovation have been objects of study internationally, but still represent a research gap in Brazil. Also there were not identified studies using the intangible asset to measure innovation and the possible relations with the organizational slack measures. This theme can also support the strategic activities of organizations, such as contributing to the creation of competitive advantage. Key methodological aspects: Descriptive research with quantitative approach was carried out using financial data of 208 companies listed in BM&FBovespa classified as innovative according to the Index Brazil of Innovation. Information regarding intangible assets, used as metrics to measure the innovation, was collected from the Notes; and the data to calculate the measures of organizational slack were collected from Economática® database. Summary of key results: In the application of the panel data model, the results demonstrate a significant relationship between organizational slack and innovation. The potential and absorbed slacks impact significantly and positively the innovative process. Non-absorbed slack influences positively, but with relatively smaller impact compared to other measures. Key considerations/conclusions: It is concluded that the results indicate a relationship in greater degree of absorbed and potential slack and to a lesser degree of non-absorbed slack with the innovation of the companies surveyed. © 2016 Mackenzie Presbyterian University.

A difference-in-differences estimation reveals that, relative to failed targets, firms acquired in diversifying mergers produce both a smaller number of innovations and also less-novel innovations, where innovations are measured using patent-based metrics. The treatment effect is amplified if the acquiring conglomerate operates a more active internal capital market and is largely driven by inventors becoming less productive after the merger rather than inventor exits. Concurrently, acquirers move R&D activity outside the boundary of the firm via the use of strategic alliances and joint ventures. There is complementary evidence that conglomerates with more novel R&D tend to operate with decentralized R&D budgets.

Few studies have examined the link from spatial layout and social networks to innovation. Social networks play important roles in structuring communication, collaboration, access to knowledge, and knowledge transformation. These processes are both antecedent to and part of the innovation process. Spatial layout structures patterns of circulation, proximity, awareness of others, and encounter in an organization. These interrelationships become fundamental to the development of social networks, especially those networks critical to the innovation process. This research explored associations between innovation within three partner organizations and the organization’s social and spatial structure. The organizations included: a nonprofit life sciences institute dedicated to translational research on cancer, the research laboratories of a multinational software corporation, and the quality control group of an automobile manufacturer. The study applied spatial analysis to map and characterize physical space in conjunction with survey data capturing social contacts among researchers at the three organizations. For one partner organization, we augmented these tools with location-tracking methods. It could be argued that sociometric surveys capture the ‘perceived’ social network. Social networks researchers have been very interested in assessing ‘real’ networks either as reliability checks on sociometric survey networks, or as stand-alone networks. Our use of an ultrawideband location system allowed us to assess networks in real time. In interpreting our results, we suggest that through exposure to moving others, locations with high metric choice may provide the opportunities for serendipitous encounters among individuals who may come from disparate parts of an organization. Whereas low mean distance to others may provide the enhanced connections necessary to mobilize the resources and attention to move innovative ideas forward. Results demonstrate the salience of both social and spatial dimensions in the processes of innovation. The research suggests two strong factors that appear to influence our results: the institutional context which characterizes or prioritizes certain innovation outcomes;the extent to which thephysical facility design of organizations tends to concentrate or spatially distribute the research unit. Our findings indicate that relationships between salutary network positions and beneficial locales themselves derive from institutional contexts that shape the priorities, opportunities, goals and practices of discovery. We suggest that innovation is a process that occurs at the intersection of social and physical space, and moves toward a sociospatial science of design for innovation. © 2014 Pion Limited.

In 2011, 1.3 billion metric tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) were generated, and this is expected to grow to 2.2 billion metric tons by 2025. In the U.S., MSW systems processed approximately 250 million tons of waste and produced 118Tg of CO2e emissions, which represents over 8% of non-energy related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and 2% of total net GHG emissions. While previous research has applied environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) to SWM using formal search techniques, existing models are either not readily generalizable and scalable, or optimize only a single time period and do not consider changes likely to affect SWM over time, such as new policy and technology innovation. This paper presents the first life cycle-based framework to optimize-over multiple time stages-the collection and treatment of all waste materials from curb to final disposal by minimizing cost or environmental impacts while considering user-defined emissions and waste diversion constraints. In addition, the framework is designed to be responsive to future changes in energy and GHG prices. This framework considers the use of existing SWM infrastructure as well as the deployment and utilization of new infrastructure. Several scenarios, considering cost, diversion, and GHG emissions, are analyzed in a 3-stage test system. The results show the utility of the multi-stage framework and the insights that can be gained from using such a framework. The framework was also used to solve a larger SWM system; the results show that the framework solves in reasonable time using typical hardware and readily available mathematical programming solvers. The framework is intended to inform SWM by considering costs, environmental impacts, and policy constraints. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Decision support; Life cycle assessment; Multi-stage; Optimization; Solid waste","Carbon dioxide; Costs; Decision support systems; Economics; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Life cycle; Mathematical programming; Municipal solid waste; Optimization; Solid wastes; Storm sewers; Waste disposal; Waste treatment; Civil infrastructures; Decision supports; Environmental life cycle assessment; Integrated solid waste managements; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Multi-stage; Multi-stage optimization; Municipal solid waste (MSW); carbon dioxide; carbon emission; cost-benefit analysis; decision support system; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; innovation; integrated approach; life cycle analysis; municipal solid waste; numerical model; optimization; policy approach; waste management; Greenhouse gases","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84884718906"

Open innovation adoption is evaluated through an accounting approach by examining all the costs, revenues, new investments and divestments of intangibles related to open transactions. The work relies on empirical data on a sample of 102 R&D intense bio-pharmaceutical companies. Results show that patent applications, body of knowledge and technological differentiation are positively correlated each other.

Particularly a reduction in the costs per cycle is much needed, which could either come from innovation in more cost-efficient manufacturing methods, a higher endurance of charge/discharge sequences or higher capacities. Looking at patent applications as a metric allows us to determine whether the necessary technological progress is indeed occurring, as the mandatory publication of the underlying inventions provides access to otherwise hidden R&D activities. Our paper contributes to the literature with a compilation of technological classes related to important battery types in the novel Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC), which can be used to identify relevant patent applications of the competing technologies. Using the worldwide patent statistical database (PATSTAT), we find that promising technologies have been showing increasing patent counts in recent years. For example, the number of patent applications related to regenerative fuel cells (e.g. redox flow batteries) doubled from 2009 to 2011. Nevertheless, the volume of patent filings in technologies related to lithium remains unchallenged. Patent applications in this area are still growing, which indicates that the introduction of improved modules will continue. Using citation analysis, we have identified important patents and organizations for relevant candidate technologies.

Numerical case studies are conducted to investigate how the system resilience is affected by different design factors, including system configuration, level of redundancy or flexibility, and buffer capacities. © 2015 The Authors.","manufacturing system design; resilience","Computer aided manufacturing; Design; Innovation; Product design; Switching circuits; Systems analysis; Throughput; Uncertainty analysis; Buffer capacity; Disruptive event; Production loss; Reconfigurable manufacturing system; resilience; Resilient systems; System configurations; System resiliences; Manufacture","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84948454774"

However, in the past, discovering insights from customers has usually depended on designers' experiences. It is hard for novice designers and designers at enterprises with G-D logic mindsets to do this well. A partial solution rests on challenging the core design practices of reframing and frame creation. However, it is rare to see how these framing design activities can be supported and analyzed by relevant tools. In this study, we present an IT-based tool with commonsense knowledge in ConceptNet to facilitate a variety of association reasoning methods in the reframing and frame creation process of service design insight discovery. We also propose the concept of insight depth to serve as a metric for measuring the influential extent of insights. This study ends up with an exploration of how the quality of the reframing and frame creation process can be improved for experienced and novice designers when supported by our tool.","Design insight depth; Design practice; Information management; Innovation; Service design","Information management; Innovation; Semantics; Commonsense knowledge; Creation process; Design activity; Design insights; Design practice; In-depth understanding; Reasoning methods; Service design; Design","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979656096"

Excellent technologies in IT, even accelerated the scientific and applied ontological pursuit in both academia as well as industry. In this work, network approach is advocated for the identification of innovations, new paradigms and emerging fields in the IT industry in the research area 'engineering'. The network is a scientific network of research publications which reflects the volume and flow of scientific activities. Centrality analysis, path analysis, cluster analysis, etc. are used to identify the key papers of paradigm shifts, emerging fields, relatively important clusters and works respectively. A new metric, flow vergence index is devised for cluster analysis. The paradigm shift identified from this network is RFID technology, related with the supply chain management.

Understanding the social and economic impacts of these shifts is a major challenge for policymakers. Richard Florida’s ideas have provided a popular – and pervasive – framework for doing so. This paper assess Florida’s legacy and sets out a ‘post-Florida’ framework for ‘technology, talent and tolerance’ research. The paper first traces the development of Florida’s ideas. ‘Florida 1.0’, encapsulated by the Three Ts framework, has performed badly in practice. There are problems in bringing causality to the fundamental relationships, and in consistently replicating the results in other countries. ‘Florida 2.0’, though suggests that Creative Class metrics have value as alternative measures of human capital. This create space for a post-Florida agenda based on economic micro-foundations. I argue that the growing body of ‘economics of diversity’ research meets these conditions, and review theory and empirics. Urban ‘diversity shocks’ shift the size and composition of populations and workforces, with impacts operating via labour markets, and through wider production and consumption networks. While short-term labour market effects are small, over time low-value industrial sectors may become migrant-dependent. Diversity may help raise productivity and wages through innovation, entrepreneurship, market access and trade channels. Bigger, more diverse cities help generate hybridised goods and services, but may also raise local costs through crowding. All of this presents new challenges for policymakers, who need to manage diversity’s net effects, and address both economic costs and benefits. © The Author(s) 2012.","Creative class; diversity; economic development; immigration; innovation","Europe; economic development; entrepreneur; human capital; immigration; innovation; multiculturalism","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84920083579"

The aim of Clean Sky is to develop and integrate new and innovative technologies that will help meeting the emission and noise reduction targets set by the Advisory Council for Aviation Research and Innovation in Europe (ACARE) for aircraft of next generation. The GRC and SAGE ITDs are responsible for developing new helicopter airframe and engine technologies respectively, whilst the TE has the distinctive role of assessing the environmental impact of these technologies at single flight (mission), airport and Air Transport System levels (ATS). The assessments reported herein have been performed by using a GRC-developed multidisciplinary simulation framework called PhoeniX (Platform Hosting Operational and Environmental Investigations for Rotorcraft) that comprises various computational modules. These modules include a rotorcraft performance code (EUROPA), an engine performance and emissions simulation tool (GSP) and a noise prediction code (HELENA). PhoeniX can predict the performance of a helicopter along a prescribed 4D trajectory offering a complete helicopter mission analysis. In the context of the TE assessments reported herein, three helicopter classes are examined, namely a Twin Engine Light (TEL) configuration, for Emergency Medical Service (EMS) and Police missions, and a Single Engine Light (SEL) configuration for Passenger/Transport missions, and a Twin Engine Heavy (TEH) configuration for Oil & Gas missions. The different technologies assessed reflect three simulation points which are the 'Baseline' Year 2000 technology, 'Reference' Y2020 technology, without Clean Sky benefits, and finally the 'Conceptual', reflecting Y2020 technology with Clean Sky benefits. The results of this study illustrate the potential that incorporated technologies possess in terms of improving performance and gas emission metrics such as fuel burn, CO2, NOx as well as the noise footprint on the ground.","","Emergency services; Emission control; Engines; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Fighter aircraft; Helicopters; Ionization of gases; Noise abatement; Rotors; Air transport systems; Complete helicopters; Emergency medical services; Environmental investigation; Improving performance; Innovative technology; Integrated technologies; Multi-disciplinary simulations; Innovation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939546456"

The survival depends on cutting back on the wasteful ways of the past, and is an opportunity for reinvention through, perhaps, creative destruction (Schumpeter and Backhaus 2003). Consequently, an opportunity to learn and adopt more frugal and sustainable ways in innovating has emerged. In this chapter, we provide a framework based on lessons in frugal innovations derived from emerging market experiences. Frugal innovation results in affordable products and services through minimizing the use of resources or by leveraging them in new ways (Govindarajan and Ramamurti 2011; Bound and Thornton 2012; Radjou et al. 2012). The lessons from successful frugal innovations in emerging countries are important-they provide a continuous and sustainable innovation approach-and help businesses and governments in the developed economies stay relevant to their stakeholders. Besides, more inclusive services innovation-as seen in examples from India, China, Africa, and other emerging countries, may ultimately ensure established businesses have a way of providing “good enough” service experiences, at low cost, and more importantly, in shortest time to benefit. © Springer-Verlag London 2015.","Disruptive innovation; Frugal innovation; Frugal services innovation; Global financial crisis (GFC); Innovation; Low-end innovation; Reverse innovation; Service innovation; “bottom of pyramid” (BOP) innovation","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947466151"

The results reveal that the relation between the strength of ties between inventors in R&D teams and the firms' technological diversity is curvilinear. In other words, while strong ties between inventors can promote diversity, there is a limit to this positive effect. After this limit, strong ties can inhibit diversity, possibly by limiting the capabilities of network members to process novelty.

In particular, one of the key trends in OI research is related to better measurement. This paper, based on a literature review of 72 studies covering the period 2003-2014, outlines the different approaches to OI adoption measurement and categorizes the metrics identified into input, process and output. The contribution of this work is both theoretical and practical. As a matter of fact, by examining OI measures, it provides a conceptual framework exhibiting the key aspects researchers dealt with in assessing OI. Moreover, such framework constitutes a useful basis for the implementation of a managerial tool, since it encloses a set of sub-dimensions that have to be measured in order to evaluate OI after a holistic perspective.","Innovation metrics; Literature review; Open innovation","Information management; Innovation; Regional planning; Sustainable development; Academic community; Conceptual frameworks; Holistic perspectives; Key trends; Literature reviews; Open innovation; Economics","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947570595"

We analyze novel data characterizing the goals of enterprise online communities, assessing the importance of goals for leaders, how goals influence member perceptions of community value, and how goals relate to success measures proposed in the literature. We find that most communities have multiple goals and common goals are learning, reuse of resources, collaboration, networking, influencing change, and innovation. Leaders and members agree that all of these goals are important, but their perceptions of success on goals do not align with each other, or with commonly used behavioral success measures. We conclude that simple behavioral measures and leader perceptions are not good success metrics, and propose alternatives based on specific goals members and leaders judge most important.","Enterprise; Goals; Metrics; Online communities; Workplace","Human engineering; Online systems; Behavioral measures; Community values; Data characterizing; Enterprise community; Goals; Metrics; On-line communities; Workplace; Industry","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84900451666"

This is contrary to what is being witnessed in other industries where innovation has transformed performance to more desirable levels. A number of scholars blamed this on the level of the industry at which previous innovation studies are undertaken as most of the studies are carried out at national and construction organization levels. At these levels, effective practice and control of innovation programme is difficult because of the large number of people contributors involved. Some other scholars believe that the metrics to which construction innovations are subjected are not adequate to capture the innovation peculiarities of the construction industry. Hence, the construction industry and its professionals are still facing the challenge of inefficiency in project delivery and services to its various clients. It is in view of these scenarios that this theoretical review is conducted with the objective of examining the appropriate levels of innovation studies and suitable innovation metrics that will enhance a more result-oriented innovation studies that will lead to greater construction efficiency. Based on the evaluation of our literature studies this paper suggests that a result-oriented innovation studies can be better achieved if appropriate innovation metrics that addresses the peculiarities of the construction industry is developed to cater for each of the various levels/units of construction industry and at relevant sub-units/levels of the construction organizations.","Construction industry; Inefficiency; Innovation; Innovation metrics","Competition; Construction industry; Information management; Regional planning; Construction efficiency; Construction innovation; Construction organizations; Effective practices; Industry innovations; Inefficiency; Innovation studies; Literature studies; Innovation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84976359258"

To satisfy the user’s requirements, designers or developers must keep into consideration also the usability methods. Unfortunately, these methods are not as organized as the TRIZ theory and often it is very challenging to apply them in an effective way. Therefore, it seems quite realistic to think through the development of innovative, as helped by a synergy between the Usability and the TRIZ theories.

However, the rate of entrepreneurship is commonly proxied using quantity-based metrics, such as small business activity, the self-employment rate, or the number of startups. We argue that those metrics give rise to misleading inferences regarding high-impact Schumpeterian entrepreneurship. To unambiguously identify high-impact entrepreneurs we focus on self-made billionaires (in US dollars) who appear on Forbes Magazine's list and who became wealthy by founding new firms. We identify 996 such billionaire entrepreneurs in 50 countries in 1996-2010, a systematic cross-country study of billionaire entrepreneurs. The rate of billionaire entrepreneurs correlates negatively with self-employment, small business ownership, and firm startup rates. Countries with higher income, higher trust, lower taxes, more venture capital investment, and lower regulatory burdens have higher billionaire entrepreneurship rates but less self-employment. Despite its limitations, the number of billionaire entrepreneurs appears to be a plausible cross-country measure of Schumpeterian entrepreneurship.","Innovation; Institutions; Regulation; Taxation","Employment; Entrepreneurship; Geography; Gross Domestic Product; Industry; Investments; Regression Analysis; Small Business; United States; innovation; institutions; regulation; taxation; article; capital; commercial phenomena; education; human; income; investment; priority journal; self employment; tax; United States","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84893517216"

As a complex and multidimensional phenomenon, innovation has been measured from different perspectives: the environment in which firms operate, firms' commitment, its outcome. A significant gap is found for Italy on most measures of innovation. Italy shows the largest gap for measures related to regulatory frameworks, ICT infrastructure and financial support for innovation expenditure. Italian firms stand out for the low level of inputs, especially the ratio of R&D expenditure and the presence of graduates. This feature is not just driven by firms' small average size: the analysis of expenditure by size shows that large Italian firms lag behind in the international comparison. A relatively large share of Italian firms claims however to innovate, even if their R&D expenditure is low. In defending intellectual property rights, firms rely more on industrial designs and trademarks than on patents. Overall, the survey confirms that innovation in Italy is more incremental than based on technology and R&D, therefore less able to increase firms' productivity and overall growth. © SOCIETÀ EDITRICE IL MULINO","Innovation; Patents; R&D","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84920185029"

This paper focuses on the integration of exterior CI through new model building energy code requirements for framed wall insulation specifically related to mandated improved energy efficiency objectives. Architects, engineers, contractors, developers, building owners, and facility managers must become better educated on building code requirements, improved energy efficiency strategies, and the positive attributes associated with exterior CI. Regional design and climate influences are significant when developing an energy-efficient wall assembly, and model building codes take no exception by stipulating insulation strategies and design values for framed wall assemblies in the eight U.S. climate zones based on adopted energy code criteria. There is a succinct relationship among overall building envelope performance, wall assembly design, and insulation type and placement. The mandated and proper integration of exterior CI along with integration of continuous air barriers in framed wall construction become increasingly important to understand, especially for national prototype projects that cross these many different climate zone areas. To this end, this paper outlines recent changes to model energy codes for insulation requirements in framed wall assemblies as well as explores strategies, options, and related challenges for implementation of exterior CI into framed wall design. This paper further conveys the positive attributes of exterior CI and the overall improvements to building envelope performance based on measurements of managed construction cost, improved energy efficiency/reduced energy consumption, and lowered environmental impact over the life of the building structure. © Copyright 2016 by ASTM International.","Continuous insulation (CI); Energy code; Energy efficiency; Exterior insulation and finish system (EIFS); Performance requirements; Prescriptive requirements; Thermal bridging","Architectural design; Building codes; Buildings; Climate models; Codes (symbols); Design; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Innovation; Insulation; Integration; Model buildings; Rain; Solar buildings; Structural design; Stucco; Thermal insulation; Walls (structural partitions); Continuous insulation (CI); Energy code; Exterior insulation and finish systems; Performance requirements; Prescriptive requirements; Thermal bridging; Energy efficiency","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84974602078"

A number of scholars blamed this on the inappropriate metrics to which construction innovations were subjected. This is because existing metrics were assessed to be inadequately capturing the innovation peculiarities of the construction industry. Hence, the construction industry is relegated to the background compared to other industries in terms of innovation adoption/practices. The conceptual paper is aimed at providing insights on the weaknesses of the existing innovation metrics and suggesting the way forward towards developing appropriate innovation metrics for enhancing better result-oriented construction industry innovation studies and practices. Based on our evaluated literature studies this paper suggests that a result-oriented innovation metrics that address innovation peculiarities of the various sub-sectors (levels/units/sub-units) of the construction industry be developed.

The ‘Class 4’ in the title refers to a set of forecast verification metrics defined in the MERSEA-IP/GODAE internal metrics document (Hernandez 2007), the defining feature of which is that comparisons between forecasts and observations take place in observation space. This approach is seen as a departure from other diagnostic approaches such as analysing model trends or innovation statistics, and is commonly used in the atmospheric community. The physical parameters involved in the comparison are sea surface temperature (SST), sub-surface temperature, sub-surface salinity and sea level anomaly (SLA). SST was measured using in-situ observations obtained from USGODAE, sub-surface conditions were compared to Argo profiles, while sea level anomaly was measured by several satellite altimeters courtesy of AVISO. The 5 forecast centres involved in the project were Met Office, Australian Bureau of Meteorology, Mercator Océan, Environment Canada and NOAA/NWS/NCEP. Combining Met Office, Mercator Océan and Environment Canada forecasts into a mixed resolution multi-model ensemble produces estimates of the ocean state which have better accuracy and associativity properties for SST, SLA and temperature profiles than any individual ensemble component. © 2015 British Crown Copyright, the Met Office.","","Argo; forecasting method; global ocean; innovation; operations technology; satellite altimetry; sea level change; sea surface temperature","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84952299730"

In this paper, we present an explicit treatment of the key uncertainties involved in learning rates' analyses of marine energy innovation (wave and tidal stream) - technology fields attracting considerable interest, but whose commercial prospects depends on substantial learning and cost reduction. Taking a simple single factor learning rate model, we describe a range of plausible learning investments required so that marine energy technologies become cost-competitive with their 'benchmark' technology: offshore wind. Our analysis highlights the sensitivity of marine energy to three key parameters: the capital cost of first devices, the level of deployment before sustained cost reduction emerges, and the average rate of cost reduction with deployment (learning rate). Figures often quoted within the marine energy sector for the parameters of starting cost, learning rate, and capacity at which sustained cost reduction occurs (metrics conventionally used for learning rate analysis) can be seen to represent very attractive scenarios. The intention of this paper is to display that even small changes to input assumptions can have a dramatic effect on the overall investment required for a sector to reach parity with benchmark technologies. In the short term, reaching cost competitiveness with offshore wind is a necessity if marine energy is to reach commercialisation. Additionally, an assessment of the plausible total investment (and inherent uncertainties) in a global wave and tidal deployment scenario will be presented. The paper also considers the implications of these uncertainties for marine energy innovation management. While the benchmark against offshore wind will generally be used as a performance indicator, in order to achieve similar and sustained cost reductions to other, more mature, renewable energy technologies (and thus achieve a competitive price for marine technologies, securing their place within the energy mix), the marine energy sector needs a targeted innovation focus to fulfil the desired objectives, and a development pathway very different to offshore wind must be used. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Experience curve; Learning curve; Learning investment; Marine energy; Technology innovation","Cost reduction; Energy policy; Engineering education; Innovation; Investments; Learning algorithms; Marine engineering; Renewable energy resources; Technological forecasting; Technology; Uncertainty analysis; Experience curves; Investment sensitivities; Learning curves; Marine energy; Marine renewable energy; Performance indicators; Renewable energy technologies; Technology innovation; alternative energy; competitiveness; innovation; investment; learning; renewable resource; sensitivity analysis; tidal power; wave power; Cost benefit analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84904178855"

We use the unconditional and conditional coverage tests to evaluate the accuracy of VaR forecasting models. Through the GARCH and Jump methodology, empirical results of Nasdaq stock indices on the period from 1 January 2000 to 28 July 2011 provide evidence of conditional Jump dynamics in Nasdaq returns.

The aim is to improve the performance of signaling procedures by applying an algorithm for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) message classification and prioritization that is proposed in our previous work. This three-priority level classification of SIP messages is implemented in Network Simulator version 2 (ns-2). Its effectiveness is verified through the simulation-based study of SIP signaling procedures under different conditions. The simulation results are analyzed in terms of Registration Request Delay (RRD), Session Request Delay (SRD), and Session Disconnect Delay (SDD). These SIP performance metrics are improved if IMS is configured to process SIP messages using the proposed algorithm. Differentiated handling of SIP messages reduces the overload in IMS and thereby improves the overall Quality of Service (QoS). This encourages our next step in research activity, i.e., implementation and incorporation of SIP message classification and prioritization algorithm into experimental environment. © 2014 FRUCT.","","Innovation; Internet protocols; Optimization; Quality of service; Experimental environment; Internet protocol multimedia subsystem; IP multimedia subsystems; Performance metrics; Research activities; Session initiation protocol; Signaling procedure; Simulation-based optimizations; Signaling","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84906544277"

Entitled ""the parents - consumers of educational brands"", which brings to our attention that the expectations and the attitudes of parents towards the superior educational system have modified in the last 15 years and at a very fast pace in the last 5 years. The methodology used in the study is a borderline from a quality-quantity point of view, and a Q factorial analysis helped in the exploratory identification of the segments, from which the most powerful 3 typologies of parents were chosen: the first one was named the demanding traditionalists for whom life is a battle and only the best is the winner (educational peer) and is characterized by a high level of involvement in the children's education, by re-editing their own experience into the life of their children. The second typology is called the relaxed modernists, parents who are satisfied with the obtained results of their children, without their evolvement but with medium expectations. The last category represents the parents with financial problems (the outsider - problematic) from ethnic groups, who live in the suburbs and present a low educational level. The research emphasis the aspects related to the cultural elements that stand as a stoneground when choosing a university, the most important sources of information, the main logistic metrics, the success ingredients in the universities environment and the main perceptions of the attitudes through a comparative approach for the public and private sector.

Because surgery does not adhere to a standardized developmental pathway, how the medical community accepts a procedure remains unclear. The authors developed a new model, using publication data and patterns, that quantifies this process. Using this technique, the authors identified common archetypes and influences on neurosurgical progress from idea inception to acceptance. Methods Seven neurosurgical procedures developed in the past 15-25 years were used as developmental case studies (endovascular coil, deep brain stimulation, vagus nerve stimulation, 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-l-nitrosourea wafer, and 3 radiosurgery procedures), and the literature on each topic was evaluated. A new metric the authors termed ""progressive scholarly acceptance"" (PSA) was used as an end point for community acceptance. PSA was reached when the number of investigations that refine or improve a procedure eclipsed the total number of reports assessing initial efficacy. Report characteristics, including the number of patients studied, study design, and number of authoring groups from the first report to the point of PSA, were assessed. Results Publication data implicated factors that had an outsized influence on acceptance. First, procedural accessibility to investigators was found to influence the number of reports, number of patients studied, and number of authoring groups contributing. Barriers to accessibility included target disease rarity, regulatory restrictions, and cost. Second, the ease or difficulty in applying a randomized controlled trial had an impact on study design. Based on these 2 factors, 3 developmental archetypes were characterized to generally describe the development of surgery. Conclusions Common surgical development archetypes can be described based on factors that impact investigative methods, data accumulation, and ultimate acceptance by society. The approach and proposed terminologies in this report could inform future procedural development as well as any attempts to regulate surgical innovation. © AANS, 2016.","Innovation; Model; Neurosurgery; Science","Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating; Brain Neoplasms; Carmustine; Deep Brain Stimulation; Depression; Diffusion of Innovation; Endovascular Procedures; Humans; Meningioma; Neurosurgery; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Publishing; Radiosurgery; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Research Design; Vagus Nerve Stimulation; carmustine; alkylating agent; carmustine; Article; brain artery aneurysm; brain depth stimulation; brain metastasis; cancer chemotherapy; cancer surgery; clinical evaluation; coil embolization; essential tremor; glioblastoma; health care cost; human; meningioma; neurosurgery; priority journal; social acceptance; stereotactic radiosurgery; surgical technique; therapy effect; treatment resistant depression; trigeminus neuralgia; vagus nerve stimulation; Brain Neoplasms; depression; economics; endovascular surgery; mass communication; methodology; neurosurgery; patient attitude; publishing; radiosurgery; randomized controlled trial (topic); secondary; trends","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84966389674"

Recent growth in Web 2.0 demands small companies to further incorporate risk management while developing innovative products. How to balance risk and innovation during new product development becomes a priority for small companies to survive the competition. Yet, the approach is not likely similar to that employed by incumbent firms. This paper explores innovation versus risk for small companies using crowdfunding products as a proxy for analysis. A database with 127 consumer electronics, namely 3D printers and smart watches, are collected from Kickstarter and Indiegogo. The metric of Real-Win-Worth is adapted to provide a well-rounded assessment of the product's innovation, risk and other related business and engineering aspects. Our result suggests a preliminary framework of innovation and risk balance for crowdfunding NPD success. A statistical model is developed to correlate the amount of crowdfunding raised with 64% predictability. These results may contribute to better understand and balance risk and innovation in crowdfunding and small company contexts.","Crowdfunding; Innovation; New product development; Risk management","3D printers; Consumer electronics; Economics; Innovation; Product development; Risk management; Crowdfunding; Engineering aspects; Innovative product; New product development; Small companies; Statistical modeling; Sustainable economic growth; Web 2.0; Risk assessment","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979688330"

Given that the competitive performance depends on the formation of intellectual capital and society's capacity to innovate, economic research has identified innovation and productivity as key engines for the increase of competitiveness. There are several alternatives approaches for measuring innovation, productivity, and competitiveness. These approaches lead to different assessments, since there is no universally accepted definition and measuring technique of the aforementioned concepts. Moreover, these definitions appear to have several overlaps and this complicates the analysis of their relations. The aim of this paper is to present a methodological framework for studying the dynamic linkage among innovation, productivity, and competitiveness and explore the implications for policy and practice. For each one of these measures, an overall score is estimated, using a regression-based model that follows the principles of multi-objective mathematical programming. For the purpose of the analysis, a database containing a set of 25 indicators for 19 countries for the period 1998-2008 has been developed. The most important results include a series of contour maps and gap analysis diagrams that illustrate the evolution of the overall innovation, productivity, and competitiveness indices and compare the performance of the examined countries. These results show that, by average, there are no significant gaps among innovation, productivity, and competitiveness, although several variations may be found for particular countries. The motivation for this research from a policy and management perspective, is to explore whether, how and why certain combinations of competitiveness, productivity and innovation levels for a given country as well as across countries reveal any particular set of intrinsic strengths or weaknesses as well as more effective entry points regarding public sector (policy) interventions. A systematic profiling and comparison of competitiveness, productivity and innovation competence levels may reveal guidelines and insights for private sector (management) choices and initiatives as well. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Competitiveness; Contour maps; Gap analysis; Innovation; Metrics; Multi-objective mathematical programming; Productivity","Innovation; Knowledge management; Mathematical programming; Productivity; Competitiveness; Contour map; Gap analysis; Metrics; Multi-objective mathematical programming; Competition","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84897586461"

The method combines creative whole-systems thinking with quantitative sustainability metrics. It facilitates innovation by the creation of visual whole-system maps that encourage more thorough and more radical brainstorming. It facilitates sustainability by using quantitative measurements, such as life-cycle assessment or point-based certification systems, to set priorities and choose final designs. The method has been anecdotally tested in classes at four universities, and many of the companies partnering with these classes have said the students provided both sustainability and feature /functionality benefits. This paper also compares the method to Lindahl’s nine recommendations for being useful to engineering designers. Thus there is at least anecdotal evidence that the design method may turn sustainability from a burden into an innovation tool.

Why and how is enterprise/entrepreneurship important for public service delivery? The growing role of enterprise within the public sector has been the subject of much recent debate and policy focus, surrounding issues such as public value, meeting targets, and the need for innovation across public services by policy makers and managers given rapid reduction of budgets in this sector. This chapter reflects on these developments and examines the effects that an enterprise focus in the public services has in terms of vocation. Drawing on the Weberian notion of vocation (1941) in politics and the sciences, what does enterprise mean for the notion of public service? Certainly, historically the public services have enjoyed a strong vocational drive from its workforce, resulting in employee loyalty, and links with communities as well as higher levels of public trust than politicians or bankers, for example. The chapter draws on examples from education, public services and localism, all of which have seen to some degree the parachuting of managers in from the private sector or the aping of these behaviours and cultures in search of more entrepreneurial delivery. Drawing on the Weberian framework of bureaucracy and vocation, the chapter examines the changing role of public service and notions of community and duty, arguably damaged by failures of the Big Society agenda (Shand & Higman, 2014; Smith, 2010) and examines if and how enterprise can maintain the ethos of public service and vocational areas of the public sector in the enduring and pressurised new public management environment of meeting targets and value metrics. Methodology/approach - The chapter adopts a Weberian approach in terms of vocation, and applies this concept to the notion of enterprise across the public services. The vocation approach in the public services, drawing upon Weber’s discussion of politics and science, underpins our discussion in this chapter as we argue that the role of innovation needs to be more widely applied and appreciated in the public services. Findings - The chapter finds that examples of innovative behaviour and delivery are evident across the public services, but these need to be understood within the context of culture, values and ethos. These underpinning goals, across several frontline and first respondent public services particularly, are driven by dedication to duty and having to respond to rapid changes in targets, ‘customer’ service, and most recently, austerity. These responses need to be seen as innovative traits, linked to leadership and the Weberian notion of vocation. Practical implications - The chapter raises several issues driven by failures or mistrust in the practical delivery and underpinning ethos of the public services. The focus on ethos has direct implications for both leadership within the public services and how these leaders’ roles and actions are interpreted by sections of wider society such as the media or the public. Notions of public trust are touched upon in the chapter, which highlight the role of key public services as different from the activities of politicians and bankers, areas which have become central to growing attitudes of mistrust among the public. The notion of vocation in the chapter is applicable to the practical arena as the role of innovation in public service needs to be reconsidered. The chapter suggests that, to date, the idea of innovation in public services has been driven by private sector innovation, and this has led to far too narrow an appreciation of what we term innovation within and across the public services. Originality/value - This chapter unites debates around trust and innovation in the public and private sectors with the Weberian ideal of vocation, drawing upon key public services and their leadership and delivery to argue that we need to understand the drivers and motivating ethos behind the public services when we consider the role of innovation and indeed how we understand and apply this term within public service delivery. © 2016 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Enterprise; Innovation; Leadership; Public services; Trust; Vocation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84982958615"

The purpose of this paper is to examine the changes in employment and value-adding profiles of transitioning industry sectors in Australia and discuss the implications for policy that influences the intellectual capital (IC) profile of industrial sectors in transition. Design/methodology/approach – The approach borrowed concepts from the firm-level strategic management literature and applied them to a macro level of industry analysis. In this paper the authors examine the transitions in the Australian economy which, due to a rising cost base, is experiencing a decline in its value chain-oriented MAN sector. The authors contrast four industry sectors with the MAN sector and examine the different value creation models. Findings – The findings clearly show how the contribution to employment and value added (termed Economic Value Contribution ) of the different sectors vary. The authors extend these findings to a discussion on policy and the dimensions of IC that may have a role to play in facilitating transitions within an economy. The main conclusion is that a more rapid transition and higher value may be created if innovation and entrepreneurship are facilitated by targeted policies in transitioning sector. Research limitations/implications – This work is based on a single country analysis of selected industry sectors. Further work needs to be done across many more countries to contrast the findings across nations/regions that differ in industrial complexity and to refine the analytical framework to improve construct validity and increase analytical power. Practical implications – This work has implications for policy-makers facing the challenges of a transitioning economy, whether national or regional. Governments that are hands-on with respect to interventions to salvage and/or extend the life of sectors are at risk of missing opportunities to build the capacities and capabilities of emerging sectors while those governments that are hands-off, deferring to market mechanisms, risk transitions that are too little and/or too late to maintain a national or regional competitiveness. Originality/value – To the authors knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate the specific firm-level strategic management perspectives, used in this paper, with the macro-policy level to examine industry sectors with the twin metrics of economic productivity and employment in transitioning economies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Entrepreneurship; Industrial revolution; Innovation; Value analysis","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84927151236"

Background: The study of health care innovation represents an emerging academic field, yet it is limited by a lack of valid scientific methods for quantitative analysis. This article explores and cross-validates 2 innovation metrics using surgical technology as an exemplar. Methods: Electronic patenting databases and the MEDLINE database were searched between 1980 and 2010 for ""surgeon"" OR ""surgical"" OR ""surgery."" Resulting patent codes were grouped into technology clusters. Growth curves were plotted for these technology clusters to establish the rate and characteristics of growth. Results: The initial search retrieved 52,046 patents and 1,801,075 publications. The top performing technology cluster of the last 30 yearswas minimally invasive surgery. Robotic surgery, surgical staplers, and image guidance were the most emergent technology clusters. When examining the growth curves for these clusters they were found to follow an S-shaped pattern of growth, with the emergent technologies lying on the exponential phases of their respective growth curves. In addition, publication and patent countswere closely correlated in areas of technology expansion. Conclusions: This article demonstrates the utility of publically available patent and publication data to quantify innovations within surgical technology and proposes a novel methodology for assessing and forecasting areas of technological innovation.

Previous studies using this model have demonstrated that nascent scientific insights and inventions generate few successful leads or new products until achieving a requisite level of maturity. This article assessed whether recent failures and successes in AD research follow patterns of innovation observed in other sectors. Methods: The bibliometric-based Technology Innovation Maturation Evaluation model was used to quantify the characteristic S-curve of growth for AD-related technologies, including acetylcholinesterase, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, B-amyloid, amyloid precursor protein, presenilin, amyloid precursor protein secretases, apolipoprotein E4, and transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43). This model quantifies the accumulation of knowledge as a metric for technological maturity, and it identifies the point of initiation of an exponential growth stage and the point at which growth slows as the technology is established. Findings: In contrast to the long-established acetylcholinesterase and NMDA receptor technologies, we found that amyloid-related technologies reached the established point only after 2000, and that the more recent technologies (eg, TDP-43) have not yet approached this point. The first approvals for new molecular entities targeting acetylcholinesterase and the NMDA receptor occurred an average of 22 years after the respective technologies were established, with only memantine (which was phenotypically discovered) entering clinical trials before this point. In contrast, the 6 lead compounds targeting the formation of amyloid plaques that failed in Phase III trials between 2009 and 2014 all entered clinical trials before the respective target technologies were established. Implications: This analysis suggests that AD drug discovery has followed a predictable pattern of innovation in which technological maturity is an important determinant of success in development. Quantitative analysis indicates that the lag in emergence of new products, and the much-heralded clinical failures of recent years, should be viewed in the context of the ongoing maturation of AD-related technologies. Although these technologies were not sufficiently mature to generate successful products a decade ago, they may be now. Analytical models of translational science can inform basic and clinical research results as well as strategic development of new therapeutic products. © 2015 The Authors.

One natural starting point for innovation and developing better strategies for sustainable manufacturing is to examine currently used best practices and how they can be adapted to meet the sustainability requirements. Lean manufacturing practices are being increasingly assessed and used as a catalyst to develop better strategies for green and sustainable manufacturing. In this regard, the potential of extending Value Stream Mapping, an important technique used in lean manufacturing to identify environmental and societal impacts/waste has received attention. A vast majority of these efforts have focused on adding energy-related metrics to Value Stream Maps while several other studies refer to 'sustainable' Value Stream Mapping, but limit emphasis to only environmental performance; the societal sustainability assessment as well as visualization methods to present the information in Value Stream Mapping are not addressed. This paper presents a comprehensive methodology to develop Sustainable Value Stream Mapping by identifying suitable metrics and methods to visually present them.

The key innovation is an efficient set of parallel software tools designed to leverage the inherited hybrid parallelism in distributed-memory clusters of multi-core machines. The performance of the toolbox is illustrated through networks derived from sea surface height (SSH) data of a global high-resolution ocean model. Less than 8 min are needed on 90 Intel Xeon E5-4650 processors to reconstruct a climate network including the preprocessing and the correlation of 3 × 105 SSH time series, resulting in a weighted graph with the same number of vertices and about 3.2 × 108 edges. In less than 14 min on 30 processors, the resulted graph's degree centrality, strength, connected components, eigenvector centrality, entropy and clustering coefficient metrics were obtained. These results indicate that a complete cycle to construct and analyze a large-scale climate network is available under 22 min Par@Graph therefore facilitates the application of climate network analysis on high-resolution observations and model results, by enabling fast network reconstruct from the calculation of statistical similarities between climate time series. It also enables network analysis at unprecedented scales on a variety of different sizes of input data sets. © 2015 Author(s).","","climate modeling; cluster analysis; data set; innovation; instrumentation; network analysis; performance assessment; sea surface height; software; statistical analysis; time series","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84945264256"

School feeding programs have been a key response to the recent food and economic crises and function to some degree in nearly every country in the world. However, school feeding programs are complex and exhibit different, context-specific models or configurations. Objective. To examine the trade-offs, including the costs and cost-efficiency, of an innovative cluster kitchen implementation model in Bangladesh using a standardized framework. Methods. A supply chain framework based on international standards was used to provide benchmarks for meaningful comparisons across models. Implementation processes specific to the program in Bangladesh were mapped against this reference to provide a basis for standardized performance measures. Qualitative and quantitative data on key metrics were collected retrospectively using semistructured questionnaires following an ingredients approach, including both financial and economic costs. Costs were standardized to a 200-feedingday year and 700 kcal daily. Results. The cluster kitchen model had similarities with the semidecentralized model and outsourced models in the literature, the main differences involving implementation scale, scale of purchasing volumes, and frequency of purchasing. Two important features stand out in terms of implementation: the nutritional quality of meals and the level of community involvement. The standardized full cost per child per year was US$110. Despite the nutritious content of the meals, the overall cost-efficiency in cost per nutrient output was lower than the benchmark for centralized programs, due mainly to support and start-up costs. Conclusions. Cluster kitchens provide an example of an innovative implementation model, combining an emphasis on quality meal delivery with strong community engagement. However, the standardized costs per child were above the average benchmarks for both lowand middle-income countries. In contrast to the existing benchmark data from mature, centralized models, the main cost drivers of the program were associated with support and start-up activities.

In effect, ""bend electrons before bending metal,"" enabling Soldier (end-user) feedback early in the design process, while fostering an atmosphere of collaboration and innovation. Simulation has been used in a variety of ways for concept, design, and testing, but current methods do not put the user into the system in ways that provide deep feedback and enable a dialogue between Warfighter and Engineer (as well as other stakeholders) that can inform design. This paper will discuss how the process of ESP is teased out by using iterative rapid virtual prototyping based on an initial ESP schema, resulting in a rather organic design process - Innovation and Rapid Evolutionary Design by Virtual Doing. By employing canonical use cases, working through the draft schema allows the system to help design itself and inform the process evolution. This type of self-referential meta-design becomes increasingly powerful and relevant given the ability to rapidly create assets, capabilities and environments that immerse developers, stakeholders, and end users early and often in the process. Specific examples of using rapid virtual prototyping for teasing out the design and implications/applications of ESP will be presented, walking through the evolution of both schema and prototypes with specific use cases. In addition, this paper will cover more generalized concepts, approaches, analytics, and lessons-learned as well as implications for innovation throughout research, development, and industry. © Copyright 2015, SISO, Inc.","Analytics; Augmented; Design; Metrics; Prototyping; Synthetic; Virtual","Helmet mounted displays; Interoperability; Iterative methods; Sensory perception; Software prototyping; Virtual prototyping; Virtual reality; Analytics; Augmented; Metrics; Synthetic; Virtual; Design","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964049135"

In this paper, we describe the Agile Translation Process (ATP) for complex innovations that was developed at the center. The process meets the constraints of the academic calendar, the knowledge needs and the typical length of stay for a master's student, and the availability constraints of the students. At the same time, the process is designed to provide value to the industry sponsor. Specifically, it describes how the process meets the needs of technology consumers in industry seeking to derive tactical value through the funding of the center. In addition, we demonstrate how to derive research results for technology providers through subsequent activities. We also provide metrics from the center for a period of five years, which show, in particular, the benefit of using the ATP method over the last three years. These metrics provide insights on how to reconcile tactical industry needs with the long-term research and funding goals of academia, while understanding the innovations needed within complex contexts. This case study also provides insights on concurrently meeting the needs of all stakeholders - including industry clients, translational faculty members, adjunct faculty from partner companies, graduate students, and the center's affiliated research faculty - within the constraints of the academic calendar.

Currently, most UserCF based recommendation systems do not consider the users' purchase precedence and activeness when locating those like-minded users. Yet, these two factors contain valuable information that can contribute to recommendation accuracy and diversity. First, according to the Diffusion of Innovations Theory (DIT), the earlier that a like-minded user purchased an item, the more likely that he would be a trend leader in his respective area of interest. Such users are called the innovators, and they should have higher level of influence on their followers than a typical like-minded user. Second, innovators are typically more active and more adventurous users. They are the ones who are more willing to try out new products of various genres, and would therefore contribute the diversity of the recommendation. Based on these reasons, we propose in this paper an improved UserCF mechanism based on innovators instead of simply likeminded users. The proposed method is simple to implement, and also applicable even in the cases where item release time is not available. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed mechanism using various metrics and the results were encouraging: our proposed scheme not only achieved the best results in term of accuracy, but also performed well in terms of diversity (including intra-list and aggregate diversity) as well.","Aggregate diversity; Collaborative filtering; Innovators; Intra-list diversity; Ordering of users; Recommendation systems","Aggregates; Innovation; Recommender systems; Area of interest; Collaborative filtering methods; Diffusion of innovations theories; Innovators; Intra-list diversity; Mechanism-based; Ordering of users; Recommendation accuracy; Collaborative filtering","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84938253806"

Based on the axiomatic definition of uncertainty as the actual prediction error of the cost estimate, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of metrics used for the uncertainty quantification of cost estimates based on a literature review, an evaluation of publicly funded projects such as part of the CORDIS or Horizon 2020 programs, and an analysis of established approaches used by organizations such NASA, the U.S. Department of Defence, the ESA, and various commercial companies. The metrics are categorized based on their foundational character (foundations), their use in practice (state-of-practice), their availability for practice (state-of-art) and those suggested for future exploration (state-of-future). Insights gained were that a variety of uncertainty quantification metrics exist whose suitability depends on the volatility of available relevant information, as defined by technical and cost readiness level, and the number of whole product life cycle phases the estimate is intended to be valid for. Information volatility and number of whole product life cycle phases can hereby be considered as defining multi-dimensional probability fields admitting various uncertainty quantification metric families with identifiable thresholds for transitioning between them. The key research gaps identified were the lacking guidance grounded in theory for the selection of uncertainty quantification metrics and lacking practical alternatives to metrics based on the Central Limit Theorem. An innovative uncertainty quantification framework consisting of; a set-theory based typology, a data library, a classification system, and a corresponding input-output model are put forward to address this research gap as the basis for future work in this field. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cost estimation; Cost readiness; Innovation; Uncertainty quantification; Whole product life cycle","Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; NASA; Propulsion; Uncertainty analysis; Actual prediction error; Axiomatic definitions; Central Limit Theorem; Classification system; Cost estimations; Department of Defence; Uncertainty quantifications; Whole product life; Life cycle","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84938741612"

Often the barriers to green building are not purely financial, they include a significant number of non-financial issues directly connected with the way green building initiatives are integrated within the management of these higher learning institutions (HLIs). The purpose of this paper is to explore the reasons behind widespread barriers and the ways in which the barriers could be overcome through strategic project management. Design/methodology/approach: The paper includes a critical review of existing literature on barriers to sustaining green building initiatives and an argument is built on the need to manage these initiatives as projects. Consequently it establishes that there is a seamless connection between HLIs strategies and projects, hence strategic project management as a framework to sustain the green campus culture. Findings: Despite numerous barriers facing African HLIs in embracing green campus buildings (GCBs) as part of their permanent business undertakings; this review strongly suggest a change of direction from “traditional approaches” to strategic project management, where all green building initiatives are transformed to programmes and portfolios dealing with sub-sets of the core business of HLIs. Practical implications: Strategic decision to include green campus building initiatives (GCBIs) as part of HLIs core strategic business projects will bring permanence in GCB thinking and resources will be allocated to GCBIs and green campus thinking may become a norm and one of the metrics for organization success. Social implications: Strategic project as a way to creating a conducive-environment for GCBIs success will become a constant and part of the way in which African HLIs are managed. Originality/value: Contemporary management approaches like strategic project management is embraced as mean for allowing under-resourced African HLIs achieving significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","African higher learning institutions; Green campus building initiatives; Strategic project management; Sustainable green campus buildings","Africa; Facings; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Sustainable development; African high learning institution; Campus buildings; Green buildings; Green campus; Green campus building initiative; Higher learning institutions; Strategic project management; Sustainable green campus building; building; emission control; greenhouse gas; greenspace; innovation; project management; strategic approach; sustainability; university sector; Project management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994430059"

The collection of information from the public was initiated by a NIST Request for Information (RFI), published in the Federal Register3, followed by a series of regional workshops sponsored by AMNPO partner agencies and focused on the issues presented in the RFI. Reports summarizing the findings from the RFI and each workshop were published.4 In January 2013, the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation: A Preliminary Design report was published, built upon public input received.5 This AMNPO document utilizes the information gathered and provides draft performance metrics that can be used to evaluate the performance of Institutes for Manufacturing Innovation (Institutes) within the NNMI program, and that would apply to the NNMI and the Institutes that are created once appropriate legislation has been enacted.6 This document is one of a series of documents generated to inform and seek feedback from the public on various elements that go into the creation and growth of the NNMI. More specifically, this document describes draft metrics that can be used to help evaluate the performance and success of Institutes within the NNMI. These draft metrics were developed by an interagency team of experts, building on the initial metrics and lessons learned from the pilot institute, the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute (NAMII). It is recognized that Institutes will vary considerably in their focus areas and perhaps in their structures as well; hence not all of the proposed metrics will be appropriate for all Institutes. However the six categories of draft metrics shown below are considered applicable to all Institutes: 7) Impact (1.1 - 1.4) 8) Industry Value (2.1 - 2.13) 9) Education and Workforce Development (3.1 - 3.6) 10) Portfolio (4.1 - 4.2) 11) Financial (5.1 - 5.5) 12) Network Contribution (6.1 - 6.4) Within each broad category, several example metrics are given, and a short rationale is included for each. The examples are not intended to be comprehensive, and Institutes should be free to propose other metrics that are applicable to their particular focus areas. Among the example metrics, an effort was made to minimize the reporting burden. Some of the draft metrics are quantitative and some are qualitative. The example metrics also include items that are measurable in short, medium, or long timeframes. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

We then suggest a set of metrics to analyze the matrices. We apply our method to a dataset of three GMB processes, finding the suggested method to be helpful for evaluating the extent to which all participants were able to include their perspectives, and whether new ideas emerged from the process, thus constituting innovation. We conclude that our method may be a valuable contribution to the evaluation of GMB processes.

A solution to this problem is innovation, which is a complex phenomenon that needs to be understood and measured in every company. The aim of this paper is to present a measurement tool to analyse the extent of innovation. The authors have divided the complex phenomenon of innovation in seven types of innovation according to their influence in the company, for each type of innovation proposing a set of measuring indicators. To widen the extent of analysis, this paper used two research methods, namely: The expert method - using the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) that focuses on the requirements for innovation performance and on a different set of indicators to calculate the importance of each type of indicator and the survey method?using a questionnaire, a representative sample of firms to check the current extent of innovation and to offer suggestions for improving innovation management.","Business improvement success; Innovation; Innovation indicators; Innovation management; Innovation matrix; Metrics of innovation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84952006748"

Proper measurement of innovation activity is therefore crucial for policymaking. In this study, a constructive analytical critique of the innovation surveys that are conducted in South Africa is presented, the case for broadening current perspectives of innovation in the national policy discourse is reinforced, the significance of a broad perspective of innovation is demonstrated and new metrics for use in the measurement of the performance of the NSI are proposed. Current NSI survey instruments lack definition of non-technological innovation. They emphasise inputs rather than outputs, lack regional and sectoral analyses, give limited attention to innovation diffusion and are susceptible to respondent interpretation. Furthermore, there are gaps regarding the wider conditions of innovation and system linkages and learning. In order to obtain a comprehensive assessment of innovation in South Africa, there is a need to sharpen the metrics for measuring non-technological innovation and to define, account for and accurately measure the 'hidden' innovations that drive the realisation of value in management, the arts, public service and society in general. The new proposed indicators, which are mostly focused on innovation outputs, can be used as a basis for plugging the gaps identified in the existing surveys. © 2015.

We present three new metrics based on the statistical mechanics of complex networks to assess forms of knowledge matches between the knowledge required by employers' projects and the knowledge offered by service providers. Based upon the results, we identify several challenges open innovation intermediaries, employers, and providers face: structuring knowledge to identify providers who can provide solutions beyond the immediate exigencies of the problem, choosing a provider among many potential matches, and choosing an online innovation intermediary when several suitable alternatives exist. The metrics provide insight into potential solutions to these challenges.

While innovative private sector models provide potential benefits to health care delivery, the evidence base on the characteristics and impact of such approaches is limited. We have developed a performance measurement framework that provides credible (relevant aspects of performance), feasible (available data), and comparable (across different organizations) metrics that can be obtained for private health services organizations that operate in resource-constrained settings. Methods: We synthesized existing frameworks to define credible measures. We then examined a purposive sample of 80 health organizations from the Center for Health Market Innovations (CHMI) database (healthmarketinnovations.org) to identify what the organizations reported about their programs (to determine feasibility of measurement) and what elements could be compared across the sample. Results: The resulting measurement framework includes fourteen subgroups within three categories of health status, health access, and operations/delivery. Conclusions: The emphasis on credible, feasible, and comparable measures in the framework can assist funders, program managers, and researchers to support, manage, and evaluate the most promising strategies to improve access to effective health services. Although some of the criteria that the literature views as important - particularly population coverage, pro-poor targeting, and health outcomes - are less frequently reported, the overall comparison provides useful insights. © 2015 Bhattacharyya et al.","Framework; Health service delivery; Innovation; Low- and middle-income countries; Performance measurement; Private sector","Developing Countries; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Income; Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care); Private Sector; Program Development; developing world; health services; innovation; performance assessment; private sector; Article; clinical practice; comparative study; controlled study; feasibility study; health care access; health care delivery; health program; health service; health status; lowest income group; medical research; middle income group; outcome assessment; priority journal; program development; program effectiveness; social status; total quality management; developing country; health care delivery; human; income; private sector; procedures; treatment outcome; trends","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84955672644"

Traditional extensive value drivers, based mainly on structural capital, are gradually extended with more intensive utilization of relational and human-resources oriented alternatives also in hospitality industry. Applying the elements of green management and sustainable development principles are characteristic trends in accommodation services. The current approach to hotel management is mostly revenue-oriented, i.e. strives to generate profit from temporally and locationally specific combinations of internal, technical and social capabilities, including, e.g. market segmentation, pricing, capacity allocation, aligned incentives, organizational structure or vocational training. Accordingly, present managers maximize metrics like occupancy (OCC), average daily rate (ADR), revenue per available room (RevPAR), revenue per available customer (RevPAC), gross operating profit per available room (GOPPAR) and many others. The paper deals with an application of green management elements in luxury class hotels in Slovakia. We used the methods of scientific work; and i.e.; the analysis method, a generalization method, mathematical, and statistical methods. Surveyed accommodation facilities reached the best results with compact fluorescent lamps and LED lamps (98 %) and sorting containers (90 %). Based on the ascertained facts, we state that accommodation facilities in Slovakia should definitely invest in the green initiatives.

The period of 2008-2012 was analyzed for a total of 340 statistical units. Our results suggest that open innovation is a very pervasive behavior among smaller and younger companies, for which internal R&D is complementary to openness; still being in the development phase, they derive most of their revenues from open innovation itself and show negative financial performances. Yet, a wider range of open transactions are performed by larger and longer established firms, exhibiting good financial performances and adopting open innovation as a substitution to internal R&D efforts. Through an in-depth review of the literature, this paper contributes to the research on open innovation by providing an accounting measurement system, testing six hypotheses among open innovation and some firm-level variables, and positioning the obtained results within the current debate. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Financial performances; inbound; innovation metrics; open innovation (OI); outbound; pharmaceutical industry","Economics; Finance; Financial performance; inbound; Open innovation; outbound; Pharmaceutical industry; Innovation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027943025"

Considered part of knowledge-intensive business services, IT services provide an output used by other sectors and play an increasingly important role in the services-based economy. Based on the theories of production, innovation and competition, we study total factor productivity growth of IT services industries in 25 Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries over the period of 1995 to 2007 using Malmquist productivity index (MPI) as the performance metric and data envelopment analysis (DEA) as the measurement methodology. We then further decompose MPI into three components that provide a full analysis: technical change (for innovation), efficiency change (for catch-up), and scale change (for demand fluctuation). These IT services industries are found to show notable productivity growth when compared with other services industries, the services sector as a whole, and the economy at large. Through a multi-theoretical lens, our breakdown analysis reveals that the IT services industry is an innovator adept at making technological progress that becomes the key driver behind observed productivity growth; efficiency change exerts a relatively small negative impact; and scale change being mainly decided by client demands impairs productivity. Implications for IT services at both country and industry levels are drawn from our findings to provide suggestions for policymaking and strategy formulation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Information technology services industry; Innovation; Malmquist index; Productivity and competitiveness","Competition; Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Industry; Innovation; Productivity; Information technology services industry; Knowledge-intensive business services; Malmquist indices; Malmquist productivity index; Measurement methodology; Organization of economic co-operation and development; Productivity and competitiveness; Total factor productivity; Information technology","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84900526012"

Design/methodology/approach: Core company's intangibles are combined into six intellectual capital (IC) elements that appear after the division of each of the traditional components (human, structural and relational capital (RC)). The human capital includes management and human resources capabilities (HRC). Structural capital is divided into innovation and internal process capabilities (IPC). RC contains networking capabilities and customer loyalty. In drawing on the relevant literature each element is described through a set of indicators collected from publicly available data. The validity of proposed IC model is justified through structural equation modeling. Each element is tested on a sample of more than 1,650 listed European companies over the period of 2004-2011. Findings: The study gives empirical support of three component IC structure and its decomposition into second level. The findings reveal that implementation of KM plays a significant role for HRC as well as for IPC. Research limitations/implications: The analysis was conducted for a particular sample that may restrict the conclusions. Practical implications: The proposed measurements for intangibles can be applied by any company for benchmarking and comparative analysis in KM. Originality/value: The study provides empirical justification of metrics for intangibles allowing a better route in an economy driven by knowledge. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Human capital; Innovation; Intangibles; Intellectual capital; Measurement; Relational capital; Structural capital; Structural equation modelling","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84897940670"

Conversely, traditional transportation planning methods have valued speed per se as an indicator of success in transportation. In examining these claims, we make two methodological innovations. The first is a new intermetropolitan gravity-based accessibility metric. Second, we decompose the impact of density on accessibility to highlight the distinct opposing influences of speed and proximity in a manner that illustrates different families of relationships between these two factors. This reveals that denser metropolitan regions have slower travel speeds but greater origin-destination proximity. The former effect tends to degrade accessibility while the latter tends to enhance it. Despite theoretical reasons to expect that the speed effect dominates, results suggest that the proximity effect dominates, rendering the denser metropolitan areas more accessible. Takeaway for practice: Having destinations nearby, as when densities are high, offers benefits even when the associated congestion slows traffic. Where land use policy frequently seeks to support low-development densities in part in an attempt to maintain travel speeds and forestall traffic congestion, our findings suggest that compact development can often improve transportation outcomes.

R&D intensity is the ratio of a firm's R&D investment to its revenue (the percentage of revenue that is reinvested in R&D). Empirical and anecdotal evidence suggests that R&D intensity within an industry tends to be remarkably consistent. Despite this consistency in R&D spending, however, firms differ with respect to their new product development (NPD) portfolio strategy and overall performance. This paper seeks to explain how R&D intensity can be so consistent at the aggregate level, while NPD portfolio strategies and firm performance are so varied at the firm level. We develop a model that considers firm level factors, such as the NPD portfolio composition and risk levels, as well as industry level factors, such as competition intensity and environmental stability. We show how a simple evolutionary process links aggregate R&D intensity and firm level portfolio choices. Our results highlight that R&D intensity alone does not explain firm performance. Rather, it is the proper alignment between R&D intensity (how much the firm invests) and an NPD portfolio strategy (how the firm invests the money) that drives profitability. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Evolutionary systems; innovation; new product development (NPD); portfolio management; R&D intensity; research and development","Aggregates; Competition; Economics; Financial data processing; Innovation; Investments; Product development; Environmental stability; Evolutionary process; Evolutionary system; Innovative activities; New product development; Portfolio managements; Portfolio strategies; Research and development; Industry","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84886729033"

Since this approach simplifies network management and speeds up network innovations, these benefits have led not just to production-intent prototypes, but real SDN deployments. For wide-area SDN deployments, multiple controllers are often required, and the placement of these controllers influences every aspect of an SDN. Since optimizing every metric is generally an non-deterministic polynomial (NP)-hard problem, it is of great importance to find an efficient controller placement algorithm. In this paper, we develop several placement algorithms to make informed placement decisions, which can be used to maximize the reliability of SDN, since network failures could easily cause disconnections between the control and forwarding planes. These algorithms are evaluated using real topologies. Simulation results show that the controller placement strategies are crucial to SDN performance, and a greedy algorithm provides placement solutions that are close to optimal. © 2012 The Journal of China Universities of Posts and Telecommunications.","controller placement algorithm; Open Flow; reliability; software-defined network","Innovation; Network management; Optimization; Reliability; Centralized control; Data planes; Greedy algorithms; Hard problems; Multiple controllers; Network failure; Open flow; Placement algorithm; Placement strategy; Wide area; Algorithms","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84867429618"

However, they require an expensive new type of fabrication facility. Multiple technology production facilities (MTPF) have become the essential incubators for these innovations. This paper aims to focus on the issues. Design/methodology/approach: The authors address the lack of managerial understanding of how to express the value and operationally manage MTPF centers through the use of investigative case study methods for multiple firms in the study. Findings: Owing to the MTPF centers' novelty and outward similarity to high volume semiconductor fabrication (HVF) facilities, they are laden with ineffective operation and strategic management practices. Metrics are the standard for both operational and strategic management of HVF facilities, yet their application to this new type of center is proving ineffectual. Research limitations/implications: These new types of regional economic resources may be at risk. A new approach is needed. Practical implications: The authors develop an operational and strategic metrics management approach for MTPFs that are based on these facilities' unique nature and leverages both the HVF and R&D metrics knowledge base. Social implications: Innovations at the interface of micro technology, nanotechnology and semiconductor micro fabrication are poised to solve many of these problems and become a basis for job creation and prosperity. If a new management technique is not developed, then these harbingers of regional economic development will be closed. Originality/value: While there is an abundance of research on metrics for HVF, this is the first attempt to develop metrics for MTPFs. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Entrepreneurship; Innovation; Metrics; Nanotechnology; Research and development; Technology","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84857562615"

An economics-driven management of data quality is in need of efficient measurement procedures, which allow for a predominantly automated identification of poor data quality. Against this background the paper investigates how metrics for the DQ dimensions completeness, validity, and currency can be aggregated to derive an indicator for accuracy. Therefore existing approaches to measure these dimensions are analyzed in order to make explicit, which metric addresses which aspect of data quality.

Using publication and citation data, it compares the degree of interdisciplinarity and the research performance of a number of Innovation Studies units with that of leading Business & Management Schools (BMS) in the UK. On the basis of various mappings and metrics, this study shows that: (i) Innovation Studies units are consistently more interdisciplinary in their research than Business & Management Schools; (ii) the top journals in the Association of Business Schools' rankings span a less diverse set of disciplines than lower-ranked journals; (iii) this results in a more favourable assessment of the performance of Business & Management Schools, which are more disciplinary-focused. This citation-based analysis challenges the journal ranking-based assessment. In short, the investigation illustrates how ostensibly 'excellence-based' journal rankings exhibit a systematic bias in favour of mono-disciplinary research.

In three years, mobile data traffic in AT&T's network rose 5000%. The US operators invest $50 billion in the data networks every year and the technology upgrades and innovation still fail to keep up with the demand. In this paper we design two algorithms for delay-tolerant offloading of bulky, socially recommended content from 3G networks. The first one, called ""MixZones"", uses opportunistic, ad hoc transfers between users, and is assisted by predictions made by the network operator. The second one, called ""HotZones"", exploits delay tolerance and tries to download contents when users are close to Wi-Fi access points; it is also assisted by predictions made by the operator. We evaluate both algorithms using a large data set, obtained from a major mobile operator and a realistic application similar to Apple's Ping music social network. The metrics address the amount of offloading, delay and mobile energy efficiency. We find that both solutions succeed in offloading a significant amount of traffic, with a positive impact on user battery lifetime. Surprisingly, we also find that all the benefit obtained from the operator with the MixZones algorithm (i.e with ad hoc exchanges between users) can be achieved with the HotZones algorithm and a small investment in Wi-Fi access points. Note that the latter is considerably less complex to deploy than the former. © 2011 IEEE.","3G offloading; delay tolerant networks; mobility prediction","Algorithms; Broadband networks; Energy efficiency; Forecasting; Innovation; Investments; Sensors; Wi-Fi; Wireless networks; 3G Networks; 3G offloading; Access points; Battery lifetime; Data network; Delay tolerant; Delay Tolerant Networks; Energy efficient; Large data; Mobile data traffic; Mobile operators; mobility prediction; Network operator; Realistic applications; Small investments; Smartphones; Social Networks; Technology upgrade; Mobile ad hoc networks","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-83355164732"

Besides carrying routing information, DBRP also transports information for common services such as the IP addresses of the DNS servers. It operates over the data link layer and is centered on Type-Length-Value (TLV) tuples, which make it easy to extend to other existing or future network protocols. Our implementation is developed in C++, and offers a GUI developed in Qt for easy configuration. We validate this first implementation under several test scenarios and have obtained very encouraging results. Additionally, the exploratory study of our application that we conduce with a group of students indicates that the protocol can be easily understood and configured through the GUI. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media.","","Authentication; Graphical user interfaces; Innovation; Internet protocols; Data link layer; DNS server; Exploratory studies; Flexible distance; IP addresss; Routing information; Test scenario; Transports information; Routing protocols","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84866634606"

First, Salinas's rhythmics are placed in historical context as part of the sixteenth-century humanistic renewal of interest in classical metrics. On the one hand, this theory belongs to a long tradition dating back to St. Augustine and beyond. On the other hand, Salinas presents several innovations for sixteenth-century rhythmic theory that have previously been overlooked. Salinas's justifications for writing on rhythmics are examined, and then the internal workings of his theory are scrutinized. Topics covered by Salinas include the mora, syllable quantity, arsis and thesis, poetic feet and rhythmus, and these are evaluated in turn. The final section discusses Salinas's use of musical examples and suggests some modifications to his theory that would be needed to analyze sixteenth-century music. © 2012 by The Society for Music Theory.

Mechanically rigidly connected moisture probe and phone (together with built-in camera and special software) are linked via a bluetooth adapter enabling thus synchronisation of moisture measurement results to exact location. Individual results are stored directly to accompanying image file used for positioning each measurement. Such approach should eliminate possible human errors common in long and tedious measurements.

Recent research has proven metrics for estimating the reverse engineering time and barrier and has shown that products can strategically be made more difficult to reverse engineer, thus protecting the innovator. Reverse engineering, however, is only the first phase of attempting to duplicate a product. Imitating - the process of discovering how to physically reproduce the performance of the reverse engineered product in one or more of its performance areas - is the second and final phase. This paper presents metrics for the time and barrier to imitating and shows how they can be joined with reverse engineering metrics to estimate a total time and total barrier to duplicate a product. As there is a cost associated with the design of barriers to reverse engineering and imitating it is important that a return on investment analysis be performed to ensure a profitable endeavor. Details of such an analysis are presented here.

Power electronics appears to be a much more complex case as an enabling technology spanning an enormous range of powers, functions and applications. Power electronics is also divided into many constituent technologies. Up to the present, the development of power electronics has been driven chiefly by internal semiconductor technology and converter circuit technology, approaching maturity in its internally set metrics (ex. efficiency). The fundamental functions found in electronic energy processing, the constituent technologies comprising power electronics and the power electronics technology space are examined critically in the light of the internal driving philosophy of power electronics and its historical development. It is finally concluded that, although approaching the limits of its internal metrics indicate internal maturity, the external constituent technologies of packaging, physical impact and converter control technology still present remarkable opportunities for development. As an enabling technology, these developments, together with internal developments such as wide band-gap semiconductors, will be driven externally by applications in future. © 2012 IEEE.","Future of power electronics","Innovation; Life cycle; Motion control; Semiconductor device manufacture; Technology; Converter circuits; Converter controls; Electronic energies; Enabling technologies; Historical development; Semiconductor technology; Wide-band-gap semiconductor; Power electronics","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84874240701"

Ours is the first list decoding algorithm for subspace codes that can handle deletions; even one deletion can totally distort the structure of the basis of a subspace and is thus challenging to handle.

So far, most research has focused on maximizing system throughput. However, this is often achieved by downgrading other performance metrics and may result in the waste of resources. In this paper, a resource allocation scheme for LTE uplink is proposed which takes into account the data rate granted by call admission control (CAC). Data rate is defined based on exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA). The scheme leads to a close match between user demand and resources actually allocated, thereby making better use of the resources. In addition, robust modulation-coding is considered in resource allocation. Results obtained via simulation show that the proposed scheme demonstrates good performance in important aspects compared to other resource allocation methods. © 2012 IEEE.","AAG-R; EWMA; LTE; robust MCS; scheduling","Innovation; Scheduling; AAG-R; Data rates; EWMA; Exponentially weighted moving average; LTE; LTE uplink; Performance metrics; Resource allocation schemes; robust MCS; System throughput; User demands; Resource allocation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84872396931"

This study into discomfort glare in open plan green buildings targeted full-time employees, working under their everyday lighting conditions. Three green buildings in Brisbane were used for data collection, two were Green Star accredited and the other contained innovative daylighting strategies. Data were collected on full-time employees, mostly aged between 30 and 50 years, who broadly reflect the demographics of the wider working population in Australia. It was discovered 36 of the 64 respondents experienced discomfort from both electric and daylight sources at their workspace. The study used a specially tailored post-occupancy evaluation (POE) survey to help assess discomfort glare. Luminance maps extracted from High Dynamic Range (HDR) images were used to capture the luminous environment of the occupants. These were analysed using participant data and the program Evalglare. The physical results indicated no correlation with other developed glare metrics for daylight within these open plan green buildings, including the recently developed Daylight Glare Probability (DGP) Index. The strong influence of vertical illuminance, Ev in the DGP precludes the mostly contrast-based glare from windows observed in this investigation from forming a significant part of this index. Furthermore, critical assessment of the survey techniques used are considered. These will provide insight for further research into discomfort glare in the endeavour to fully develop a suitable glare metric. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Discomfort glare; Green buildings; Luminance mapping; Office lighting; Open plan; POE","Australia; Brisbane; Queensland; Buildings; Daylighting; Glare; Population statistics; Surveys; Australia; Brisbane; Critical assessment; Data collection; Daylight source; Discomfort glare; Full-time employees; Glare indices; Green buildings; High dynamic range images; Lighting conditions; Luminance map; Open plan; Open-plan offices; POE; Post occupancy evaluation; Techniques used; Working population; building; innovation; light; luminescence; office location; vision; workplace; Glare effects","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84870450713"

The study is based on experimental measurements on 45-nm SiGe pMOSFETs with a high-κ/metal gate stack, as well as on 45-nm Si pMOSFETs with identical gate stack for comparison. In the reference SiGe technology, an innovative technological solution is adopted that limits the SiGe material only to the channel region. The resulting SiGe device merges the higher speed of the Ge technology with the lower leakage of the Si technology. Appropriate circuit- and system-level metrics are introduced to identify the advantages offered by SiGe technology in VLSI circuits. Analysis is performed in the context of next-generation VLSI circuits that fully exploit circuit- and system-level techniques to improve the energy efficiency through aggressive voltage scaling, other than low-leakage techniques. Analysis shows that the SiGe technology has more efficient leakage-delay and dynamic energy-delay trade-offs at nominal supply, compared to Si technology. Moreover, it is shown that the traditional analysis performed at nominal supply actually underestimates the benefits of SiGe pMOSFETs, since the speed advantage of SiGe VLSI circuits is further emphasized at low voltages. This demonstrates that SiGe VLSI circuits benefit from aggressive voltage scaling significantly more than Si circuits, thereby making SiGe devices a very promising alternative to Si transistors in next-generation VLSI systems. © 2011 IEEE.","Aggressive voltage scaling; digital circuits; emerging technologies; energy efficiency; power-delay trade-off; Silicon-Germanium; VLSI","Digital circuits; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Germanium; Heterojunction bipolar transistors; Innovation; Logic circuits; Logic gates; MOSFET devices; Silicon; Silicon alloys; Technology; Emerging technologies; Power-delay tradeoff; Silicon Germanium; VLSI; Voltage-scaling; VLSI circuits","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84862684939"

For this reason, this paper presents a comparative evaluation of eight collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms, mainly focusing on recommendation algorithms related to dimension reduction techniques, on two common popular datasets by using three quality metrics. The eight algorithms are the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm, three native dimension-reducing algorithms respectively based on singular value decomposition (SVD), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and weighted non-negative matrix factorization, and four hybrid algorithms respectively crossing principal component analysis: PCA and KNN, SVD and KNN, NMF and KNN, and PCA and a recursive rectangular clustering. There are some interesting findings in our experiments. First, dimension-reducing techniques can help dig out more valuable information from the rating data than the nearest-neighbor technique. Second, in comparison with four hybrid algorithms, three native algorithms only based on dimension-reducing techniques are able to better satisfy users' actual needs. Third, dimension-reducing techniques with non-negativity constraints are more effective than not with non-negativity ones. Fourth, the decision on the optimum algorithm among eight algorithms is insensitive to the sparsity of dataset. Fifth, proper selections for appropriate values of parameters of algorithms are very often problem dependent. Sixth, native dimension-reducing algorithms can defeat these algorithms related to KNN in the processing time. These findings not only show that it is necessary to evaluate in detail these algorithms under the uniform test framework but also play an important role in the right navigation for further innovation research on the technology of the personalized recommendation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Importance of a variety of factors that affect bacterial activity in unsaturated and saturated zones was widely studied on the site and influence of natural and technological factors on clean-up efficiency in heavily contaminates areas of clean-up fields (initial contaminant mass 111-452 metric ton/ha) was evaluated. Long-term monitoring of the groundwater temperature has shown seasonal rises and falls of temperature which have caused a fluctuation in biodegradation activity during clean-up. By contrast, an overall rise of average groundwater temperature was observed in the clean-up fields, most probably as a result of the biological activity during the clean-up process. The significant rise of biodegradation rates, observed after air sparging intensification, and strong linear correlation between the air injection rates and biodegradation activities have shown that the air injection rate is the principal factor in biodegradation efficiency in heavily contaminated areas. It has a far more important role for achieving a biodegradation activity than the contamination content which appeared to have had only a slight effect after the removal of about 75% of initial contamination.

Recently, Hassidim proposed a model for multi-core paging [25], studying cache eviction policies for multi-cores under the traditional competitive analysis metric and showing that LRU is not competitive against an offline policy that has the power to arbitrarily delay request sequences to its advantage. While Hassidim brought attention to this problem, an effective and realistic model with accompanying competitive caching algorithms remains to be introduced. In this paper we propose a more conventional model in which requests must be served as they arrive. We study the problem of minimizing the number of faults, deriving bounds on the competitive ratios of natural strategies to manage the cache. We show that traditional online paging algorithms are not competitive in our model. We then study the offline paging problem and show that the problem of deciding if a request can be served such that at a given time each sequence has faulted at most a given number of times is NP-complete and that its optimization version is APX-hard (for an unbounded number of sequences). We show as well that although offline algorithms can benefit from properly aligning future requests by means of faults, an algorithm that does so by forcing faults on pages that it has in its cache has no advantage over an honest algorithm that evicts pages only when faults occur. Lastly, we describe offline algorithms for the decision problem and for minimizing the total number of faults that run in polynomial time in the length of the sequences. © 2012 ACM.","cache; chip multiprocessor; multi-core; online algorithms; paging","Computer science; Innovation; Microprocessor chips; Polynomial approximation; cache; Chip Multiprocessor; Multi core; On-line algorithms; paging; Algorithms","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84856494392"

The metric is sensitive to prevailing land use patterns and commuter flows in the metropolitan region, time budgets, and the spatial distribution of joint activity locations. It is calculated via a geocomputation routine in which a representative subset of after-work, space-time prisms are intersected with each other. Decomposition of the metric gives rise to social potential metrics for each employment and residential zone in the city, for specific commuter flows, and for locations of potential social interaction, such as bars, restaurants, sports fields, and so on. The method is demonstrated via a scenario-based experiment that explores the impact of residential and employment land use patterns and varying levels of commuter flow dispersion. The findings indicate that the metric is adequately responsive to each of the scenario input parameters, as well as pairwise combinations of parameters. Following the experiment, an empirical example using flow data from Salt Lake City, Utah, is presented. Insights on how to introduce more realism in the calculation of the metric for actual metropolitan regions for comparative purposes are then put forward. Finally, the article concludes with a discussion of the broader applications of this metric to various topical areas in urban geography including segregation, social capital development, innovation and creativity, and location allocation of facilities and their opening hours. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","geocomputation; joint accessibility; social interaction potential; time-geography; urban spatial structure","Salt Lake City; United States; Utah; Salt Lake City; United States; Utah; accessibility; commuting; land use planning; location-allocation model; metropolitan area; spatial analysis; spatial distribution; urban planning; accessibility; commuting; empirical analysis; employment; innovation; land use; metropolitan area; social capital; spatial distribution; urban geography; urban society","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84876438581"

In order to expand the markets and maximize profits, IPTV providers need to create more appealing programs and better broadcasting schedules by understanding the usage patterns and user behaviours. They can gather log data from the set-top box (STB) and network devices. However, due to huge amounts of log files in large-scale IPTV system, it is not easy to perform deep analysis for various metrics on time. The volume of log data is expected to increase rapidly because of the explosive growth of users. For the efficient management of analysis jobs for diverse metrics under a large set of log data, in this paper, we propose MapReduce-based IPTV log analysis methods on the cloud computing platform, called Hadoop. We carried out experiments with a small testbed and a large one with Amazon service, and found that the MapReduce-based approach outperforms the DBMS by 13 times.

One of the challenges of administrating this program is to balance the need to foster innovation in small businesses and the need to demonstrate commercialization by infusion into NASA. Because of the often risky nature of innovation, SBIR programs will tend to drift into a status that rewards proposals that promise to deliver a product that is exactly what was specified in the call. This often will satisfy the metric of providing a clear demonstration of infusion and thus also providing a publishable success story. However, another goal of the SBIR program is to foster innovation as a national asset. Even though data from commercially successful SMD SBIR tasks indicate a higher value for less innovative efforts, there are programmatic and national reasons to balance the program toward risking a portion of the portfolio on higher innovation tasks. Establishing this balance is made difficult because there is a reward metric for successful infusion and commercializetion, but none for successful innovation. In general, the ultimate infusion and commercialization of innovative solutions has a lower probability than implementation of established ideas, but they can also have a much higher return on investment. If innovative ideas are valued and solicited in the SBIR program, then NASA technology requirements need to be specified in a way that defines the problem and possible solution, but will also allow for different approaches and unconventional methods. It may also be necessary to establish a guideline to risk a percentage of awards on these innovations. 1 © 2013 IEEE.","","NASA; Professional aspects; Profitability; Space applications; Innovative ideas; Innovative solutions; Lower probabilities; NASA technology; Return on investments; Science missions; Small business; Small business innovative researches; Innovation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84878696884"

In response to policy demands for triple-bottom-line assessments, developing transdisciplinary endeavours has been a primary focus, catalysing methodological innovations. However, the period of innovation has increased the divergence between a science domain characterised by increasing complexity of communicated analytical outputs and a policy domain that generally remains impelled towards single metric outcomes. We argue that this new phase will see the focus shift from method innovation towards the design of research processes to correct the discrepancy.

This paper provides evidence for how the ChaRL framework can (1) establish and maintain an effective science-policy interface despite high levels of complexity and high levels of contested values and (2) challenge and reconstruct existing knowledge, providing a robust foundation to evidence-based decision making.

However, landscape-scale goals such as increased habitat connectivity are difficult to deliver with site-based prioritization metrics. Assessing alternative ways to re-connect landscapes is a complex task, requiring knowledge of how biodiversity will respond over time to alternative conservation actions, such as replanting, managing areas of natural regrowth or protecting existing habitat. It also presents computational challenges since projects must be assessed as combinations rather than individually. We investigated practical aspects of ecological metric design to achieve desired spatial configurations. Realistic, mock bids were submitted by members of the local community in a simulated tender exercise for enhanced cassowary habitat near Mission Beach, Australia. Optimization heuristics helped solve the problem within a reasonable time. Our results demonstrate that integrating whole-landscape assessment models with market-based instruments can feasibly address the inherent complexity when pursuing whole-landscape ecological benefits through cost-efficient and innovative means.

This paper presents a novel sport video summarization algorithm by mining consistent field-of-views applied visual and temporal information in a totally unsurprised manner. After videos are broken into shots, a content-based similarity measure is proposed in the shot level to structurally analysis the visually matching cost of original videos. Then modified agglomerative hierarchical clustering is performed with an energy-based function to match the statistical distribution of various views in game videos and a refined distance metric is proposed as similarity measure of two shots. Extended temporal prior is introduced to meet the fact that temporally neighbored shots with similar duration are more likely to be in the same clusters. Experiments on a database of 6 sport genres with over 10251 minutes of videos from different sources achieved an average accuracy of 91.5% and quantitative results are presented to justify each choice made in the design of our algorithm.

In-situ and embedded sensors, while more reliable and accurate, can be costly and in many cases infeasible for SHM because they require installation in hard-to-reach places or during construction. Remote sensing (RS) technologies such as radar, electrooptical imaging and laser scanning may offer an innovative, cost-effective method of monitoring the dynamic conditions of U.S. bridges in real-time. While some RS techniques may be costly for state agencies to deploy on their own, RS imagery is available through government agencies or commercial vendors for moderate or no cost. How can disparate RS datasets be integrated with one another and with inventory data in a way that is meaningful to bridge asset management decision makers? This paper discusses the development and functionality of the Bridge Condition Decision Support System (DSS), a web-based asset management tool for bridge managers and inspectors.

Using quantitative metrics to describe the input and output, by conducting semi-structured interviews with officials, scientists, and other decision makers, and by reviewing available documents as well as a case study on the coal sector we examined the changes in the decision making process, particularly in regard to the role of scientists. We found that the changes in strategic priorities set by China's high level political leaders were implemented and then transformed into outputs by using scientists as inputs or policy tools. The decreased role of scientists has been driven by two forces: (1) periodic changes in national strategy emphasizing technology commercialization; and (2) changes in the management structure involving low tolerance of risk.

The continuously growing energy consumption of data centers makes data centers promising candidates with significant potential for DR. Participating in DR programs makes data centers have another finical resource in addition to service income. On the other hand, some government organizations also offer considerable incentives to promote energy saving actions for facilities with some certain certifications. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system developed by U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) is one of the most popular certification systems. LEED uses Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) as one of the metrics for quantifying how energy efficient a data center is. The goal of PUE is to improve energy efficiency of a data center. DR programs require participants to temporarily reduce their power demand on some occasions with little concern regarding energy efficiency. To enjoy incentives from LEED certification, data center administrators need to know whether the participation of DR hampers the established PUE of their facilities or not. This paper examines the power consumption models from prior studies, and identifies the constraints introduced by PUE for data centers participating in DR programs. The examination reveals that the ratios of static power consumption to the dynamic power demand range of different types of data center equipment do affect PUE while taking demand reduction efforts. With this finding, facility managers of data centers have a clear picture of what to expect from the DR participation, and what to adjust of their data center equipment. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Data center; Demand response; Energy efficiency; Power usage effectiveness","Energy utilization; Innovation; Certification systems; Data centers; Demand reduction; Demand response; Demand response programs; Dynamic Power; Energy efficient; Facility managers; Government organizations; Killer-application; Leadership in energy and environmental designs; Power consumption model; Power demands; Power usage; Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE); Rating system; Smart grid; Static power consumption; U.s. green building councils; Energy efficiency","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84873930909"

The objective of this paper is to reconsider the evidence from that study by drawing on innovation adoption theories. Design/methodology/approach: The paper re-examines the findings from case study-based research that investigated leading e-business performance measurement practices. The study suggests that there are limitations in analysing the findings using normative best practice, the dominant paradigm within performance management. Given that e-business innovation relies on the adoption of multiple technologies this paper reconsiders the findings using the conceptual perspective of the innovation adoption literature. Findings: The study highlights the importance of individual, cognitive, social and cultural influences in an organisation's operating environment on its willingness to adapt performance measurement metrics for online business activities. The findings point to the benefits available from incorporating new theoretic perspectives in performance measurement research. Research limitations/implications: The work points to a need to adopt a more context-specific approach to the development of e-business performance measurement. Furthermore, it indicates ways in which both the understanding and practice of performance measurement in e-business can be advanced.

The measurement of e-business (EB) value has been traditionally considered as a single construct. However, the desire to develop a comprehensive understanding of the impact of EB applications from a theoretical perspective has resulted in the modelling of multiple EB constructs. The impact of EB enabled collaboration on operational performance was also investigated. The purpose of this paper is to explore the enabling role of multiple dimensions of EB investigating if all EB applications impact directly and positively on supply chain collaboration. Design/methodology/approach: A web-based survey was carried out to collect data within the German automotive industry. Structural equation modelling was conducted to test the measurement and structural model. Findings: The results provide justification for the modelling of EB in multiple dimensions. Furthermore, some EB applications impacted positively on supply chain collaboration whilst some did not. The results also proved that EB enabled collaboration impacted directly and positively on the multiple dimensions of operational performance tested. Practical implications: EB applications cannot be viewed by practising managers as being universally beneficial in improving collaboration across a buyer-supplier boundary. However, the results reveal that, by carefully selecting the most appropriate EB applications, operations improvement benefits can be realised across a range of operational metrics due to enhanced supply chain collaboration. Originality/value: The deconstruction of EB into multiple constructs will enable the measurement of EB value to be more accurately assessed. Furthermore, the direct impact of EB-enabled collaboration to facilitate interaction and integration and its impact on operational performance adds to the body of knowledge within the larger research field of supply chain collaboration. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Collaboration; E-business technologies; E-business value; Germany; Innovation; Operational performance; Supply chain management","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84871999280"

In this context, companies actually face some troubles: limited knowledge about available tools, difficulty in coming to know and using innovative systems, and complexity in evaluating the impact of the technology on design collaboration. The present research suggests a novel collaborative environment (the CoReD platform) that merges system simplicity, project-oriented approach and customizable functions. It defines a metric-based protocol considering both performances and cognitive aspects to assess collaboration quality and then monitors design review sessions within three industrial Consortia. Research contributions are to answer two main questions: how to arrange a low-cost co-design environment and how to effectively evaluate the human-system interaction and collaborative performance in industrial use. Experimental results highlight that the CoReD platform is able to efficiently improve collaborative processes by affecting both product-process performance and human-based collaboration, mainly thanks to: system architecture simplicity, low cost, high customizable functionalities and ease of use for remote design. However, results demonstrate also that significant advantages can be achieved only if industrial partners have a good level of technical expertise and high motivation to collaborate each other. © 2011 by ASME.","Co-design; CVE (Collaborative Virtual Environment); Human-Computer Interaction (HCI); Industrial applications; Multidisciplinary teamwork","Industrial applications; Innovation; Co-design environments; Co-designs; Cognitive aspects; Collaborative environments; Collaborative performance; Collaborative process; Collaborative virtual environment; Customizable; Design collaboration; Design review; Ease-of-use; Exploratory studies; Human-system interaction; Industrial partners; Industrial use; Innovative systems; Low costs; Multidisciplinary teamwork; System architectures; Technical expertise; Product design","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84863590806"

We propose a two steps algorithm that does not impose any constraints on the scene. The purpose of the first step is the extraction of a convenient 'Projective Reconstruction' using a simple method. Indeed, it firstly initializes the projective calibration of the scene and then refines it using non-linear optimization. The extracted reconstruction is then integrated in the second step consisting on the upgrade of the reconstruction to a metric one; this is done through the research of the camera intrinsic parameters necessary for the upgrade stage. A multi-stage auto-calibration algorithm is proposed to iteratively estimate each parameter alone and finally refines all of them at once. Once these parameters are obtained, the 3D Euclidean reconstruction of the scene is extracted using a publicly available Multi-View Stereo software. © 2012 IEEE.","3D reconstruction; Camera Auto-Calibration; multi-stage algorithm; Projective Reconstruction; Structure From Motion","Algorithms; Calibration; Cameras; Innovation; Iterative methods; Three dimensional computer graphics; 3D reconstruction; Auto calibration; Multi-stage; Projective reconstruction; Structure from motion; Three dimensional","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84874462635"

Practically the good technique which dominates on the video surveillance applications is the statistical representation of pixels in foreground which named Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). In the second part of this paper we control the people entering in a supervised region and we trigger an alarm system in order to find out person presence. © 2012 IEEE.","Background Subtraction; Error; False Negative Error; False Positive; Moving Object Detection; Surveillance system","Alarm systems; Errors; Innovation; Motion estimation; Object recognition; Pixels; Video signal processing; Background subtraction; False negative errors; False positive; Moving-object detection; Surveillance systems; Security systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84874460739"

Although we may rely on a large number of low level measurements to this end, their interpretation and the way of connecting them to high level quality attributes is always a challenge. In this paper we report on a complex project involving industrial partners whose aim is the development of a unified software quality platform that deals with and bridges these low and high level quality aspects, and provides a basis for the industrial applications of the approach. The project is implemented by a consortium of software industry members of the Szeged Software Innovation Pole Cluster and associated researchers with the support from the EU co-financed national grant promoting innovation clusters of small and middle-sized enterprises. The approach to the unified quality platform is based on the Goal-Question-Metric paradigm and a supporting software infrastructure, and its novelty lies in a unified representation of the low level metrics and the high level questions that evaluate them to address software quality assurance goals. It allows the definition of various complex questions involving different types of metrics, while the supporting framework enables the automatic collection of the metrics and the calculation of the answers to the questions.

Quantifying stove adoption requires affordable tools, scalable methods and validated metrics of usage. We quantified the longitudinal patterns of chimney-stove use of 80 households in rural Guatemala, monitored with Stove Use Monitors (SUMs) during 32 months. We counted daily meals and days in use at each monitoring period and defined metrics like the percent stove-days in use (the fraction of days in use from all stoves and days monitored). Using robust Poisson regressions we detected small seasonal variations in stove usage, with peaks in the warm-dry season at 92% stove-days (95%CI: 87%, 97%) and 2.56 average daily meals (95%CI: 2.40, 2.74). With respect to these values, the percent stove-days in use decreased by 3% and 4% during the warm-rainy and cold-dry periods respectively, and the daily meals by 5% and 12% respectively. Cookstove age and household size at baseline did not affect usage. Qualitative indicators of use from recall questionnaires were consistent with SUMs measurements, indicating stable sustained use and questionnaire accuracy. These results reflect optimum conditions for cookstove adoption and for monitoring in thisproject, which may not occur in disseminations undertaken elsewhere. The SUMs measurements suggestthat 90% stove-days is a more realistic best-case for sustained use thanthe 100% often assumed. Half of sample reported continued use of open-cookfires, highlighting the critical need to verify reduction of open-fire practices in stove disseminations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Diffusion of innovations; Energy use behavior; Fuel and stove stacking; Improved stove dissemination; Indoor air pollution; Monitoring and evaluation","Guatemala [Central America]; Drought; Indoor air pollution; Scalability; Surveys; Diffusion of innovations; Energy use; Improved stoves; Monitoring and evaluations; Optimum conditions; Poisson regression; Quantitative metrics; Seasonal variation; accuracy assessment; atmospheric pollution; cooking appliance; household energy; indoor air; innovation; Poisson ratio; pollution monitoring; quantitative analysis; rural area; seasonal variation; sustainability; technology adoption; Stoves","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84887018286"

A complete Raman spectrum is acquired by scanning a sample under an excitation laser and a 1D fiber array, producing separate images of the sample at every wavelength in the spectrum. It provides an advantage over traditional single-point Raman systems, as acquiring one spectrum takes milliseconds and a full 3D image occurs within a few minutes. High-resolution Raman spectra make this the preferred technique for biomedical diagnostics and research. Analysis by the researchers show that the key metric for any Raman system is optical throughput efficiency of the Raman spectra. This instrument improves test speed while maintaining high SNR and resolution across the spectral band.","","Health care; Innovation; Laser excitation; Sensors; Spectroscopy; 3-D image; Bio medical diagnostics; Excitation lasers; Fiber array; High resolution; High SNR; Hyperspectral sensors; Medical professionals; Multipoint; Optical throughput; Raman systems; Spectral band; Spectral imaging; Spectral sensors; Test speed; Raman scattering","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84867721266"

It will cause the information loss and uncomfortable for listeners in voice over IP. This investment proposed an approach based on waveform similarity measure using overlap-and-Add algorithm. The waveform similarity overlap-and-add (WSOLA) technique is an effective algorithm to deal with packet loss concealment (PLC). For real-time time communication, the WSOLA algorithm is widely used to deal with the length adaptation and packet loss concealment of speech signal. Time scale modification of audio signal is one of the most essential research topics in data communication, especially in voice of IP (VoIP). Herein, we proposed the dual-side WSOLA that is derived by standard WSOLA. Instead of only exploitation one direction speech data, the proposed method will reconstruct the lost voice data according to the preceding and cascading voice. The dual-side WSOLA can use both the past and future speech signal waveform to reconstruction voice waveform of lost packet. The evaluations show that the quality of the reconstructed speech signal of the dual-side WSOLA is higher than that of the standard WSOLA and GWSOLA on different packet loss rate and length using the metrics: PESQ and MOS. The significant improvement is obtained by dual side information in the proposed method.

The reported data was determined to be the most recent at the time of a presentation of this material to NFAIS in February 2012. The goal of this paper is to be objective and informational. Each of the selected indicators will be described in a high-level with a brief review of significant results. This paper will illustrate that there is no one 'global leader' across the various categories that are reviewed. The data will show that well established economies, such as the US and EU countries continued to maintain significant levels of funding and achievement, yet these data will also demonstrate how leading positions are being eroded by rapid advances among emerging economies led by China. The Regionally Developing Economies (RDEs) are visibly increasing their positions in various rankings. The data also shows that some of the smaller, yet more established economies, such as Switzerland achieved top positions when a variety of input and output pillars and sub-pillars are utilized within the assessment methodology. Switzerland has long been considered to be a wealthy economy. Finally, the presentation will review, at a high-level the status of STM publishing within an increasingly global market. The paper will summarize recent activities and point to selected RDE markets where local STM market forces are emerging, either in the form of incumbent global publishers who are establishing presence via local partnerships or country-specific publishing operations. In addition, the emerging markets feature notable in-country participants. © 2012 - IOS Press and the authors.","Brazil; BRIC; China; Competition; economic performance; education; GDP; global competition; global competitiveness; India; innovation; Japan; RDE; STM publishers; USA","Competition; Education; Innovation; International trade; Brazil; BRIC; China; Economic performance; GDP; Global competition; Global competitiveness; India; Japan; RDE; STM publishers; USA; Reviews","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84872286040"

Analogy matching is made possible by the novel incorporation of Non Uniform Rational B-spline (NURBs) based metamodels enabling the efficient representation of critical function performance. The concept of critical functionality is central to this research effort. Metamodels of the performance of critical functions, obtained from simulations, engineering models (such as bond graphs) and/or experimental data collections, will be organized into a searchable repository of innovative analogies. This approach will enable multiple analogies to be presented to the designer with a quantified match metric related to the desired performance benefit to the design. The impact of this approach for inspiring novel designs will be measured through controlled experiments measuring the impact of the analogies on the innovation of design. The ultimate research goal will be verified using MetaAnalogy via Performance Specification (MAPS) technique at both the conceptual design phase and throughout the design process.

We require good theory both to suggest which metrics are needed and to interpret the resulting data. In this paper we return to the literature in order to build a conceptual framework to guide the measurement of innovation. In addition we perform an initial validation of the framework against an online repository of content on innovation measurement and in so doing we arrive at a taxonomy of innovation metrics. While useful in its own right, the taxonomy also highlights both the strengths and weaknesses in the current approach to innovation measurement. Finally we use the framework to draw out four key questions that should be addressed by management before choosing appropriate metrics.

Also, whether organizational learning advance innovation performance by playing a mediating role between Six Sigma and innovation performance, probing the moderating effects of organizational types between six sigma and organizational learning, and also testing a proposed model to explain the relationships among Six Sigma, organizational type organizational learning, and innovation performance through an empirical examination in the Indian industry context. Design/methodology/approach: Correlations are used to analyze the degree of relationship between constructs and to further understand the direct and indirect effects, as well as the moderating and mediating effects among the constructs in model, structural equation modeling is conducted using AMOS 6.0 on data collected from Indian industries. Findings: This study proves the positive relationship between Six Sigma and organizational learning. It also confirms that Six Sigma role structure and Six Sigma focus on metrics contributes positively to organizational innovation, however, Six Sigma structured improvement procedure was found to be negatively related to organizational innovation, thus contributing to Six Sigma-Innovation Paradox. This study also rejects moderating effects of organizational type between Six Sigma and organizational learning. Research limitations/implications: Cultural context is a critical factor not only on Six Sigma, but also organizational learning, and organization innovation for investigating hence future study should consider this aspect. This research suggests the need for more intensive research to explore in more depth the relationship between Six Sigma structured improvement procedure, and the administrative and the technical innovation to identify the existence of potentially mediating variables in order to understand what is named the Six Sigma-Innovation Paradox. Practical implications: The findings are useful for business managers in developing countries such as India, who want to enhance business performance through implementing Six Sigma practices that support their firm's product and services innovation efforts. Originality/value: The study has contributed to establishing an empirical research between Six Sigma, organizational learning and organizational innovations that facilitates more quality management research in developing countries. It has contributed to clarifying the disputed relationship between Six Sigma practices and the firm's learning and innovativeness, and shows empirical evidence in India to confirm that the Six Sigma practices deployed by a firm has a positive impact on its organizational learning.

Innovation measurement initiatives assess innovation capability, output and performance to help develop such an understanding. This study explores various aspects relevant to innovation measurement ranging from definitions, measurement frameworks and metrics that have been proposed in literature and used in practice. A systematic literature review followed by an online questionnaire and interviews with practitioners and academics were employed to identify a comprehensive definition of innovation that can be used in software industry. The metrics for the evaluation of determinants, inputs, outputs and performance were also aggregated and categorised. Based on these findings, a conceptual model of the key measurable elements of innovation was constructed from the findings of the systematic review.

Emerging from laboratory product-tests, it has evolved into a corporate testing service that measures the consumer reactions to products/concepts using a wide range of analyses/metrics. We propose that CR transform itself in light of accelerated knowledge expansion, mounting global, and local economic pressure on corporations and changing consumer needs. The transformation moves from its traditional testing into creating profoundly new knowledge of the product and understanding of the corporation's current and future customers. CR's tasks will involve: contributing/expanding science, applying open innovation principles, and driving consumer-centric innovation. We identify seven paradigm shifts that will change CR, namely: a different way of working-from testing to open sourcing; from good corporate citizen to change leader; open new product development (NPD) process; new management roles/cultures; universities and industry, new education curricula, and cooperation; from battle over control to sustainable sharing is winning model (SiW); and the central role of design. This integrative, innovative CR requires the implementation of three recommendations: start the change process now, fine-tune along the way; create a new marketing/CR department; and educate and professionalize. These recommendations provide the blueprint for jump-starting the process and call for immediate actions to deal with the severity of the crises facing the CR profession. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","consumer research; Food and beverages; new product development; open innovation; paradigm shift","Beverages; Consumer Behavior; Food; Food Industry; Humans; Marketing; Research; Beverages; Curricula; Industry; Innovation; Product development; Beverages; Curricula; Product design; Product development; Consumer research; Consumer-centric; Economic pressures; Food and beverage industry; Knowledge expansion; New product development; Open innovation; Paradigm shifts; Consumer research; Economic pressures; Food and beverage industry; Knowledge expansion; Laboratory products; New product development; Open innovation; Paradigm shifts; consumer; controlled study; human; human experiment; leadership; marketing; model; occupation; product development; university; beverage; consumer attitude; education; food; food industry; organization and management; research; trends; food industry; review; Research; Innovation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84877285812"

Given a graph G the goal of graph densification is to come up with another graph H that has significantly more edges than G but nevertheless approximates G well with respect to some set of test functions. In this paper we focus on the case of cut and spectral approximations. As it turns out graph densification exhibits rich connections to a set of interesting and sometimes seemingly unrelated questions in graph theory and metric embeddings. In particular we show the following results: • A graph G has a multiplicative cut approximation with an asymptotically increased density if and only if it does not embed into l 1 under a weak notion of embeddability. We demonstrate that all planar graphs as well as random geometric graphs possess such embeddings and thus do not have densifiers. On the other hand, expanders do have densifiers (namely, the complete graph) and as a result do not embed into l 1 even under our weak notion of embedding. • An analogous characterization is true for multiplicative spectral approximations where the embedding is into l 2 2. Using this characterization we expose a surprisingly close connection between multiplicative spectral and multiplicative cut densifiers. • We also consider additive cut and spectral approximations. We exhibit graphs that do not possess non-trivial additive densifiers. Our results are mainly based on linear and semidefinite programs (and their duals) for computing the maximum weight densifier of a given graph. This also leads to efficient algorithms in the case of spectral densifiers and additive cut densifiers. © 2012 ACM.","","Algorithms; Computer science; Densification; Innovation; Complete graphs; Efficient algorithm; Embeddings; Graph G; Metric embeddings; Non-trivial; Planar graph; Random geometric graphs; Semidefinite programs; Spectral approximations; Test functions; Graph theory","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84856446527"

Since its introduction in industry and academia, the Scenario Graph has helped design teams to capture new values and behaviors of potential customers during the problem formulation stage. At the same time, the Scenario Graph, sharing a common challenge with various design methods, has faced difficulty regarding validation of its effectiveness as a design method. This paper describes a validation framework for a method in problem formulation stages and an experiment, which compare ideation results of 87 people-43 people with the Scenario Graph method (as a test group) and 44 people with the Brainstorming (as a control group) - to solve an identical problem. While the results show no statistically significant difference in the number of ideas generated, the data reveals statistically significant differences in the quality of ideas. The test group, which used the Scenario Graph, yielded ideas that were more novel, feasible, and abstract than the control group, which used the Brainstorming, did. These metrics represent a way to measure the quality of ideas in the domain of engineering design. Our experiment confirms the hypotheses that the Scenario Graph is effective in improving the performance of idea generation sessions, which is consistent with qualitative evaluations.

Yet most simple information appeals remain ineffective and are rooted in an outdated understanding of human behavior. In this article, we report on policy lessons from the Rewire program, an innovative energy conservation campaign at the University of Toronto that has grown to reach over 12,000 community members in Canada's largest university. Drawing from the Rewire experience, which evaluated the program by using a mix of psychological, electricity, and qualitative metrics, we suggest cost-effective methods for delivering policy interventions in a complex institutional setting and explore effective methods to generate widespread changes in energy behaviors through a community-based social marketing approach. Campaign designers should move away from single-tool policy interventions to employ a coordinated set of tools and techniques that address a wide range of determinants of human behavior. By training community-based coordinators, campaign designers should also move away from hierarchical policy implementation and toward decentralized deployment of modular and locally adaptive campaigns. For behavioral change to make a meaningful contribution to energy policy, we emphasize the need for more regular dialogue between social science research and the community of energy conservation practitioners.

Congestion in the network can increase the delay of packets to be routed between sources and destinations, so it should be avoided. The routing decision can be based on local or non-local congestion information. Methods based on local congestion condition are generally simple but they are unable to balance the traffic load efficiently. On the other hand, methods using non-local congestion information are more complex while providing better distribution of traffic over the network. In this paper, we explored several proposed locally and non-locally congestion-aware methods. Then we discussed about their advantages and disadvantages.

This innovation identified new potential for enhancing crew safety of the Orion vehicle through the adaptation of techniques pioneered for military aircraft survivability. The benefit of this approach became apparent in early applications as vehicle evolution trade studies were undertaken when new advantages of potential designs were identified through the study of design options through SCS and considered in the trade study decisions. Three years after the award, Spacecraft Vulnerability Reduction (SVR) has grown from a concept to an application. Where only System Reliability, Crew Survival and System Safety were applied, SVR brings further closure of gaps to prevent loss of life for potential mishap scenarios by complementing but not duplicating efforts in System Safety, Reliability, and Crew Survival and providing a more comprehensive design and assessment approach. This innovation has been embraced by the aircraft survivability world with recent developments for potential collaboration of efforts. These techniques must be developed and applied to space design, now, in order to support human missions to Mars. The example set by military aircraft programs teaches the road to developing and implementing a structured survivability program is long and could take decades to mature. Collaborative work has begun with the Naval Post Graduate College and NASA in efforts to gain expertise and expand what is traditionally done for spacecraft safety by applying new techniques to support design survivability decisions, drive designs through new survivability requirements, and measure the effectiveness of these techniques through a new system metric. This paper describes the program as envisioned and currently implemented, the achieved and projected benefits to the NASA project Orion, and insight into the future of Survivability and potential benefits beyond Orion to other human and uncrewed space applications where common concerns such as optimizing safety while minimizing weight are priority concerns. Work being performed now includes the Damage Modes and Effects Analysis (DMEA) and Methodology Document written for Spacecraft application, Emergency Return Mode application to affect design and operational scenario development, additional robustness to lowered fault tolerance systems, and program development. The DMEA follows the widely know Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA). Where the FMEA identifies the possible failures and hazards, the DMEA plays through the failures and analyzes the damage and its cascading events. To this day, safety requirements only look at the susceptibility: ""how likely is it to happen?"", and design only to prevent occurrence to a certain level of reliability. SVR is the practice of assuming the hazard has occurred. What then? By identifying these vulnerabilities during the design phase, LM is able to create a safer spacecraft, while having positive impacts on budget and schedule. This paper will propose the potential future of survivability driven design to strengthen the synergy between aircraft and spacecraft as we prepare for the moon, Mars and beyond. © 2010 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.","","Aircraft accidents; Design; Failure analysis; Fault tolerance; Innovation; Military aircraft; Military vehicles; NASA; Optimization; Quality assurance; Safety factor; Space applications; Space flight; Structural dynamics; Aircraft survivability; Assessment approaches; Cascading events; Collaborative Work; Comprehensive designs; Crew safety; Damage modes; Design option; Design phase; Drive design; Effects analysis; Failure modes and effects analysis; Fault tolerance system; Human mission; Human spaceflights; Lockheed Martin; Loss of life; NASA projects; New system; Operational scenario; Potential benefits; Program development; Safety requirements; Space design; Spacecraft application; Spacecraft safety; Spacecraft vulnerability; Support design; Survivability engineering; System reliability; System safety; Trade-study; Spacecraft","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84855634404"

Finally we describe the presented metrics in details, using an example, and evaluate them Theoretically and empirically. © 2011 Global IT Research Inst.","autonomy; CRUD matrix; measurement; Service quality attributes; structural complexity","Innovation; Maintainability; Reusability; Analytical approach; Appropriate metrics; autonomy; CRUD matrix; Mathematical foundations; Quality attributes; Quality services; Research areas; Service oriented modeling; Service Quality; Service quality attributes; Service-oriented computing; Structural complexity; Quality of service","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79955700068"

This represents a huge amount of money and energy, from which a good part is for the preservation and renovation of the existing pavements. The problem of asphalt is that it oxidizes with time and therefore its beneficial properties disappear. Traditionally, rejuvenators spread in the road surface, are used to restore the original properties of the pavement. The problem is that, for a rejuvenator to be successful, it must penetrate the pavement surface. Furthermore, application of a rejuvenator will reduce the skid resistance of the pavement and, besides, rejuvenators have many aromatic compounds that can be harmful for the environment. To solve these problems this paper introduces a new concept in road construction: encapsulated rejuvenators. The basic principle is that when the stress in capsules embedded in the asphalt reaches a certain threshold value, the capsules break and some rejuvenator is released, restoring the original properties of the pavement. This paper will show how to prepare such capsules and how to determine their characteristics. This is one of the first steps towards intelligent pavements. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Ageing; Asphalt concrete; Capsules; Rejuvenators","Calorimetry, Differential Scanning; Hydrocarbons; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Particle Size; Thermogravimetry; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Pavements; Problem solving; Skid resistance; aromatic compound; asphalt; concrete; industrial chemical; rejuvenator; unclassified drug; Ageing; Asphalt concrete; Asphalt concretes; Basic principles; Capsules; Pavement surface; Rejuvenators; Road surfaces; age; asphalt; concrete; innovation; pavement; road construction; article; chemical composition; computer assisted tomography; construction work; encapsulation; microscopy; oxidation; temperature measurement; thermal analysis; Asphalt","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77957867323"

A prime example is the overfetch feature in DRAM, where a single request activates thousands of bitlines in many DRAM chips, only to return a single cache line to the CPU. The focus on cost-per-bit is questionable in modern-day servers where operating costs can easily exceed the purchase cost. Modern technology trends are also placing very different demands on the memory system: (i) queuing delays are a significant component of memory access time, (ii) there is a high energy premium for the level of reliability expected for business-critical computing, and (iii) the memory access stream emerging from multi-core systems exhibits limited locality. All of these trends necessitate an overhaul of DRAM architecture, even if it means a slight compromise in the cost-per-bit metric. This paper examines three primary innovations. The first is a modification to DRAM chip microarchitecture that retains the traditional DDRx SDRAMinterface. Selective Bitline Activation (SBA) waits for both RAS (row address) and CAS (column address) signals to arrive before activating exactly those bitlines that provide the requested cache line. SBA reduces energy consumption while incurring slight area and performance penalties. The second innovation, Single Subarray Access (SSA), fundamentally re-organizes the layout of DRAMarrays and the mapping of data to these arrays so that an entire cache line is fetched from a single subarray. It requires a different interface to the memory controller, reduces dynamic and background energy (by about 6X and 5X), incurs a slight area penalty (4%), and can even lead to performance improvements (54% on average) by reducing queuing delays. The third innovation further penalizes the cost-per-bit metric by adding a checksum feature to each cache line. This checksum error-detection feature can thenbe used to build stronger RAID-like fault tolerance, including chipkill-level reliability. Such a technique is especially crucial for the SSA architecture where the entire cache line is localized to a single chip. This DRAM chip microarchitectural change leads to a dramatic reduction in the energy and storage overheads for reliability. The proposed architectures will also apply to other emerging memory technologies (such as resistive memories) and will be less disruptive to standards, interfaces, and the design flow if they can be incorporated into first-generation designs.

In recent years, more focus has been directed towards intangible innovation such as business model, networking and brand innovation. This category has shown to have great impact on a firm's long-term value creation. Still, most measurements on company innovativeness have been focused on different types of tangible innovation. Furthermore, existing models do not, to our knowledge, seize the company's innovativeness importance and performance within the category of intangible innovation and only briefly within tangible innovation. Most companies use a predefined definition when designing innovation metrics instead of deriving from the company's own innovation perspective and thus conclude the company's innovativeness and recognizing the potential of innovation within the company. We have created an innovation measurement tool for firms to evaluate their company. This study has resulted in a measurement model, the Perception of Innovation in Companies model (PIC), which measures homogeneity between tangible and intangible innovation as well as differences in perceived innovativeness importance and actual performance for the company's overall success. The model uses an emic approach and has been tested on four companies in southern Sweden. The strength with our model is that it captures the respondent's perception of how important innovation is for the company's overall success at the same time as it captures how well the company is performing within different types of innovation. Thus the PIC-model can aid decision makers and management. © 2011 IEEE.","classification of innovation; emic; employee perception; innovation; innovativeness; intangible; New measures of innovation; performance; success; tangible","Decision making; Industrial management; Measurements; emic; Employee perceptions; Innovativeness; intangible; New measures of innovation; performance; success; tangible; Innovation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80052978251"

Exploration and confirmation risks and costs are a major cause for the slow development of this clean, baseload energy source. Currently, the surface and subsurface are characterized through combinations of ground-based and remote geophysical surveys, geochemical and geological surveys, modeling and drilling. More accurate and efficient exploration technologies are necessary to reduce the upfront risk and cost of discovering and defining these hidden resources. In order to identify critical technologies and technology gaps where research and development investment can lead to important advances, the U.S. Department of Energy Geothermal Technologies Program (the Program) is developing a geothermal exploration technologies roadmap. To this end, the Program held a planning workshop in October 2010. The workshop brought together a diverse group of experts from industry, academia and government to identify potential advances to pursue over the coming years, specifically with regard to technologies that have the greatest potential to contribute to the Program's goal of identifying new geothermal prospects and lowering the cost of geothermal development. The product of that workshop was an Innovative Exploration Technologies Needs Assessment (U.S. Department of Energy, 2011) that identifies ten technology needs that are deemed to represent areas where technology advances would have the greatest potential impact on exploration success and increasing geothermal capacity. The technology advancement needs identified through this work provided the groundwork for further technology roadmapping. The Program, in collaboration with stakeholders, will use the identified high-impact research areas from the needs assessment to develop technology pathways with milestones and metrics to advance geothermal exploration technologies. This paper discusses the results of the needs assessment and plans to further develop a technical roadmap for exploration technologies.","Characterization; Exploration; Geochemistry; Geology; Geophysics; Remote sensing; Roadmapping","Characterization; Costs; Geochemistry; Geological surveys; Geology; Geophysics; Geothermal fields; Geothermal prospecting; Investments; Natural resources exploration; Planning; Remote sensing; Technology; Baseload; Critical technologies; Energy source; Geophysical surveys; Geothermal capacity; Geothermal development; Geothermal exploration; Ground based; Hidden resources; Needs Assessment; Potential impacts; Research and development; Roadmap; Roadmapping; Technology advancement; Technology advances; Technology gap; Technology roadmapping; U.S. Department of Energy; U.s. geological surveys; Western United States; Innovation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84860852474"

In this paper, the interrater reliability of three existing metrics is analyzed by applying them to the results of a representative idea generation study. The effects on inter-rater agreement of analyzing concepts at the overall concept level versus the feature level are investigated, along with the impacts of alternative scales for specific metrics. In general, the inter-rater reliability of the metrics is found to be relatively low, with the most reliable results obtained at the feature level. The use of different scales also affects inter-rater reliability, but the effect is less significant. In addition to their low levels of repeatability, the metrics differ in how novelty is appraised.

We are currently conducting such an assessment for geothermal energy technology with particular emphasis on Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS). In this paper, we will report our efforts to forecast the implications of innovation and their impact on future cost of power from EGS. Specifically, we have conducted a detailed assessment of technology advancements and innovations across drilling, well stimulation, and power plants. Leveraging patent data, paper literature, and detailed expert elicitations, we have inventoried a number of innovations and new technologies ranging in maturity from conceptual to commercially proven albeit in complementary industries such as oil and gas. Further, we have developed estimates of improvements along performance and cost metrics for each of these innovations. Finally, we have used a number of analytical models including the U.S. Department of Energy's Geothermal Electric Technologies Evaluation Model (GETEM) to assess the levelized costs of electricity (LCOE) for a series of cases with varying levels of technology improvements. Preliminary results show that cost reductions range from 20%50% for drilling, 5%-30% for well construction, 20%-40% for well stimulation, and 10%-38%forpowerplants. Based on these improvements, the LCOE for an illustrative EGS system can be reduced up to 40% from a reference case.

How can you customize your course website with supplemental materials for students? How can you find a collection of self-studies that can be used to guide a department as they prepare for the ABET review process? This workshop introduces faculty who are interested in integrating digital learning materials in their courses to a set of criteria and methods useful in selecting and evaluating the quality of these materials to help achieve their course goals. The workshop focuses on the 10,000 educational resources cataloged in the Engineering Pathway digital library (www.engineeringpathway.org) and goes through the resources and tools available for faculty to use to locate, evaluate and select helpful digital learning materials to achieve their teaching and learning goals. Participants will be introduced to a general intellectual framework for integrating digital learning materials that stresses identifying the particular learning objectives and pedagogies for the use of particular materials. Participants will be introduced to two sets of evaluation criteria, those used in the Premier Award for Excellence in Engineering Education Courseware and another set that is used to guide catalogers as they register materials in a digital library. They will have a hands-on opportunity to apply these criteria to better understand the metrics for quality in digital learning materials, and how to apply these metrics to materials they are considering using to help achieve their course goals. The workshop also helps faculty locate courseware that can help satisfy the ABET criteria for evaluation. For those preparing for the ABET review process, the Engineering Pathway identifies a number of self-study that can be used to guide departments in the development of measurement instruments and processes. Lastly, the workshop will introduce new tools for student engagement with history of technology and well as current news in each discipline.

In the decoder, multiple-symbol differential detection (MSDD) is used to calculate the branch metric. Channel autocorrelations are considered in MSDD to mitigate the effects of channel variation, in the Rayleigh fading channels.

Both the original designer and those reverse engineering the original design can benefit from estimating the time and barrier to reverse engineer a product. This paper presents a set of metrics and parameters that can be used to calculate the barrier to reverse engineer any product as well as the time required to do so. To the original designer, these numerical representations of the barrier and time can be used to strategically identify and improve product characteristics so as to increase the difficulty and time to reverse engineer them. As the metrics and parameters developed in this paper are quantitative in nature, they can also be used in conjunction with numerical optimization techniques, thereby enabling products to be developed with a maximum reverse engineering barrier and time - at a minimum development cost. On the other hand, these quantitative measures enable competitors who reverse engineer original designs to focus their efforts on products that will result in the greatest return on investment.

Intelligent resources organization in such systems is closely coupled to the principles of Semantic (Intelligent) Web. One of the existing widespread applications of semantic web is Electronic learning (E-learning) service which is deemed to be ""Education at all stages"". The prerequisite of this semantic-driven resource management and content delivery in E-learning service has been facilitated by building Ontology thus playing a key role in managing and distributing the resources semantically. Out of the several challenging issues present in the construction of ontology, the problem of anaphora resolution (resolving pronouns) has a greater impact on the expressiveness of the constructed ontology. Anaphora resolution in the web documents with highly related sentences has obtained greater importance in the research area of semantic web. The crux contribution of the paper is to present a framework known as DEKA for constructing and visualizing ontology for the web documents based on Computational Linguistics (rule-based model). The paper also addresses the working of some of the automatic ontology construction methodologies. The experimental data sets taken from the web corpus have been found to produce promising results for the performance metrics. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Anaphora Resolution; Computational Linguistics; E-learning; Ontology; Semantic (Intelligent) Web; Web Services","Computational linguistics; E-learning; Information science; Information technology; Innovation; Interoperability; Ontology; Semantic Web; Anaphora resolution; Automatic ontology; Content delivery; Electronic learning (e-learning); Experimental data; Heterogeneous systems; Intelligent resource; Ontology construction; Performance metrics; Research areas; Resource management; Rule-based models; Web Corpora; Web document; Web services","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-81255214579"

To enhance media quality in case of packet errors, Forward Error Correction (FEC) mechanisms are the preferred error-control schemes for interactive multimedia applications. However, random error behavior causes unstable media quality so that average quality is not a sufficient metric to represent media quality. In this paper, we first propose a novel short-term quality metric to represent the short-term media quality. Second, based on this metric, we develop adaptive FEC mechanisms to determine appropriate FEC redundancy to protect media packets under various wireless error models.

Although the multi-threaded operating systems have an advantage of developing higher-level applications and services more intuitively, there are no researches about implementing the IPv6 on top of them.

And we introduce a secure protection method that mitigates thread stack overflow, which may frequently occur with long computations such as handling IP packets in multi-threaded operating systems. As a result, the proposed method ensures that relatively long IP-related functions are executed safely.

Firms are ranked according to the Patent Asset Index, which is derived from a set of newly developed patent indicators.

This article espouses the latter hypothesis and tries to understand if a governance perspective brings about a higher level of innovation in metropolitan areas. In order to test this hypothesis, two metrics are designed:. In measuring innovation, the ideas are that there are four dimensions in urban innovation (agenda innovation, process innovation, product innovation and innovative communication) and that a metropolitan city has to score high in most of them in order to be considered really innovative. As far as governance is concerned, the analytical proposal is that the ideal governance network is at the same time complex (bringing together actors from different territorial levels and from different societal and institutional domains), dense (favouring direct interaction between the actors) and 'focused' (showing one or few actors able to act as focal points of the network).

This article takes stock of Europes current competitive position within the global bioeconomy, drawing on a variety of metrics in the three intersecting spheres of innovation governance: science, market and society. These data then provide a platform for reviewing the problems of innovation governance faced by the EU and the strategic choices that have to be confronted in the regenerative medicine sector. © 2010 Future Medicine Ltd.","Europe; finance; governance; innovation; patenting; regulation","Biotechnology; Capital Financing; Drug Industry; Europe; Internationality; Japan; Organizational Innovation; Patents as Topic; Regenerative Medicine; Research Support as Topic; United States; biotechnology; capital; economic aspect; economic evaluation; Europe; funding; government regulation; health care cost; health care manpower; health care policy; human; income; industrial production; investment; marketing; medical research; patent; priority journal; product development; regenerative medicine; reimbursement; research ethics; resource management; review; stem cell transplantation; training","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78649368907"

To reduce the power consumption of the state metrics cache (SMC), low-power memory-reduced trace back maximum a posteriori algorithm (MAP) decoding is proposed. Instead of storing all state metrics, the trace back MAP decoding reduces the size of the SMC by accessing difference metrics. The proposed trace back computation requires no complicated reversion checker, path selection, and reversion flag cache. MAP decoders are necessary components of powerful iterative decoding systems such as Turbo codes. For double-binary (DB) MAP decoding, radix-2*2 trace back structures are introduced to provide a trade off power consumption. Trace back MAP decoding: In this, the trace back MAP decoding is proposed to trace the state metrics back by accessing the difference metrics. Trace back convolutional decoding: In the conventional path, the state metrics computed by the natural recursion processor (NRP) in the natural order are stored in the SMC. These two trace back structure, MAP decoding structure achieve power reduction of the state metrics cache.

Here we examine the text of patent records (specifically, titles and abstracts) to identify which features are responsible for the high impact on later innovations. We use the TFIDF metric (term frequency times inverse document frequency) to identify which words best convey a patents explicit content. Because a new patent is required to cite all important earlier patents (""prior art"") that introduced innovations on which the new patent depends, we use the TFIDF scores of words in citing patents to identify a patent's emergent content. A patent's emergent content explains its impact on subsequent inventions; it reflects what traits in an invention actually led to a significant number of subsequent innovations. We illustrate two ways to visualize the explicit and emergent content of patents: word arrays and clouds. Examining the emergent content of populations of patents issued during different epochs reveals when important new ideas appear in the evolution of technology and how they affect its subsequent evolution.","","Biological systems; Innovation; Text processing; Evolution of technology; High impact; High-content; Inverse Document Frequency; Prior arts; Term Frequency; Two ways; Patents and inventions","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79955697402"

The sustainability factors are identified from the nickel recovery process and modeled in metrics to evaluate economic and environmental impacts. The results suggest that the economic profitability of nickel recovery from wastes strongly depends on nickel market values and it also increases over production batch size.

Both potential employers and accrediting agencies, such as ABET, expect students to gain proficiency in teamwork skills through experiential learning. Teamwork based projects challenge the student to apply the technical knowledge they gain in school to solve meaningful and complex problems. However, to be truly proficient in teamwork, a student must also learn and practice a large number of peripheral skills. These include planning, estimating, tracking progress, taking corrective actions, managing change, controlling and managing risks, maintaining ethical and professional conduct, communicating complex ideas clearly and concisely, using design automation tools, leveraging web-based tools for team collaboration, and most importantly participating effectively as team members. It is essential that students should be taught these important skills. It is unlikely that without adequate faculty guidance students can pick up these skills through ad-hoc project experience. Yet, many engineering and computer science programs expect the students to do just that. We feel strongly that we need to employ a more pragmatic approach in teaching students the skills necessary to function as effective and productive team members. Additionally, we need to develop criteria for assessing the effectiveness of teaching teamwork and the tools to measure learning outcomes. Among the problems contributing to this situation are the following: engineering and computer science instructors themselves often have had little or no experience operating in teams; training or guidance in effective ways to teach teamwork is seldom provided; and tools and effective approaches to assist in the teaching and assessment of teamwork are lacking. Another problem is that, it takes a great deal of faculty time, effort and energy to guide groups of students in doing effective teamwork. We will describe an approach that we have used to teach team collaboration skills using free and freely available web-based tools. Students learn to use tools for design automation, metrics collection, project management, and web-based collaboration. Our approach encourages students to learn teamwork skills and improves levels of collaboration among team members while reducing demands on faculty time and effort. Use of web-based collaboration tools allows students to participate without the need for frequent face-to-face meetings; this our students love. In an effort to maximize the use of techniques like the ones described in this paper, we hold regular informal sessions of interested faculty to share ideas on improving teaching teamwork and to develop methods and tools for assessment. The paper and the conference presentation will describe both our approach and the results we have obtained. © 2011 IEEE.","agile process; assessment; experiential learning; Teamwork; web-based collaboration","Computer aided design; Computer science; Education computing; Innovation; Project management; Rating; Risk management; Teaching; Websites; Agile process; assessment; Experiential learning; Teamwork; Web-based collaboration; Students","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84858268919"

Beginning in about 2000, a need emerged for methods with which to assess the effects of advanced information systems on driver workload early in product development—surrogate methods that were valid, practical, and applicable before on-road driving studies could be done with instrumented vehicles. Surrogate methods that emerged included techniques such as visual occlusion, peripheral detection tasks, the lane-change test, and other techniques. As these methods have been studied, a variety of questions emerged about their possible use and role in the context of driving simulation. Role of Driving Simulators. Driving simulators are an important tool for examining responses of drivers to the driving scenarios they present. Simulators are themselves a kind of surrogate—a surrogate for the overall driving experience on the road, in scenarios—of interest. In that context, this chapter explores what role other surrogate methods might play—how they are different, as well as how they can be used together with simulation—in the study of driving behavior. Key Results of Studies for Appropriately Applying Surrogates and Simulations. Studies in different venues (lab, simulator, track, and road) have been done which provide key findings that are salient for how best to use surrogates and simulations together in research. These findings are reviewed, with an emphasis on building robustness into research designs. Scenarios and Dependent Variables. Examples of the sorts of surrogates that can be incorporated in simulation are discussed, along with surrogates that are implemented as simulations. Issues are identified, along with opportunities for innovation through simulation. Generality.

One of the important mechanisms to fully utilize the scarce bandwidth is congestion control. Especially, congestion detection, a module of congestion control, plays an essential role since the source rates should be adapted according to the detected network congestion. Due to the various dynamics of IEEE 802.11 WMNs, wireless congestion control mechanisms usually use complicated combination of various metrics, such as channel-idle time, interface queue length and average link-layer retransmission in intermediate nodes. However, this metric combination requires the sophisticated design of congestion control mechanism and eventually leads to the optimization difficulty. Thus, we propose a simple-yet-effective congestion detection metric, CORE (COngestion Residual timE). CORE measures the expected time of congestion-loss occurrence on the interface queue between IP and MAC layers. We obtain CORE by measuring the residual queue length and the slope of the queue length and then refining them with signal processing schemes (e.g., triangular moving average and linear regression). Moreover CORE provides over-generated rate information that is essential to the congestion control mechanisms. By taking a series of experiments, we verify that CORE accurately predicts the time of congestion-loss occurrence as well as the over-generated rate. © 2011 Global IT Research Inst.","","Bandwidth; Innovation; Internet protocols; Queueing theory; Refining; Signal processing; Standards; Wireless mesh networks (WMN); Congestion Control; Congestion control mechanism; Congestion detection; Expected time; Idle time; IEEE 802.11 wireless mesh networks; IEEE 802.11s; Intermediate node; MAC layer; Moving averages; Network congestions; Queue lengths; Residual time; Retransmissions; Source rate; Wireless Internet access; MESH networking","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79955678771"

Each home presented some unique design challenges, but common design approaches have emerged which can be extended into the design of larger structures. These include: - True NZE construction requires some form of onsite energy generation, likely solar photovoltaic (PV) technology. The marginal cost per kW of this technology becomes the metric against which all design approaches or innovations are assessed. - The cheapest way to meet this cost metric is to focus on energy conservation measures and technologies. No further energy technology investment is warranted when the cost of this incremental investment exceeds the marginal cost of additional PV technology. - Energy modeling needs to become an early, iterative and ongoing discipline for every design team - One supporting theme for all other elements in the design approach is a focus on simplicity; Simple, elegant solutions are more desirable, because they are usually less expensive and more reliable that competing approaches that meet the same efficiency goal. The authors will elaborate on these ideas in the paper. © 2011 ASHRAE.","","Costs; Design; Heating; Investments; Technology; Cost metrics; Design approaches; Design challenges; Design team; Energy conservation measures; Energy modeling; Energy technologies; Incremental investments; Marginal costs; On-site energy; Solar photovoltaic technology; Innovation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84856661918"

Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a case study approach to examine knowledge work and knowledge management in virtual teamwork in a large UK telecommunications company to understand the occurrence of emergent knowledge and how it is managed by virtual team leaders. The section in the company studied is described as a ""knowledge intensive organization"" dealing with the company's e-commerce activities. Findings: The analysis confirms the complex adaptive system hypothesis - a complex system adapts to its environment through self-organization. The data reveal the behaviour of the virtual team to be self-organizing and adaptive to its environment. It confirms the knowledge tacitness hypothesis and social embeddedness of knowledge hypothesis as important determinants of knowledge sharing. Specifically, the data reveal the main issues concerning knowledge sharing practices of virtual team workers and the crucial team leader's role in the effectiveness of the teams' capability to develop social links to externalise and share tacit knowledge to accomplish tasks. Research limitations/implications: In this paper, the authors contribute ""emergent knowledge"" as a third category of organizational knowledge in addition to the existing tacit and explicit knowledge that needs to be considered when designing KMS. It also derives socio-technical systems design principles based on the theory of deferred action, and a tentative development process with metrics is then proposed for KMS design that caters for emergent, tacit, and explicit knowledge. Practical implications: Existing models such as the SECI model do not acknowledge emergent knowledge or its conversion into explicit knowledge. The theory of deferred action is invoked to derive design principles, termed deferred systems design principles, to depict how explicit knowledge, tacit knowledge, and emergent knowledge can be represented to design knowledge management systems for ""emergent organizations"". Originality/value: The study contributes to the limited research and lack of consideration of emergent knowledge as an integral part of organizational knowledge, especially in an era of emergent organizations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Deferred design principles; Electronic commerce; Emergent knowledge; Explicit knowledge; Innovation; Knowledge management systems; Organizational knowledge; Socio-technical systems; Tacit knowledge; Theory of deferred action","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80053311132"

Advances in robots and automation utilizing high-fidelity sensors capable of characterizing dynamic and unconstrained environments represent one crucial area for development. Robots with the ability to perceive their surroundings can adapt to variable manufacturing conditions and even cooperate with human partners. 2D video-based computer vision has been the standard for robot perception for over two decades. Recent advances in 6-Degree-Of-Freedom (DOF) metrology and 3D optical sensing methods have created the potential for high-accuracy, high-resolution, real-time sensing of dynamic environments. This capability will revolutionize automated manufacturing by enabling systems to perform flexible and complex tasks that previously required human perception and dexterity. The enabling 3D sensors and the perception software behind them are rapidly evolving. There are several fundamental sensing technologies and many software approaches to make practical use of the data. Unfortunately, standard evaluation methods have not kept pace with the development of this new sensing technology. The selection of a sensing system cannot therefore be made objectively using manufacturer provided specifications alone. This lack of standardization has slowed the acceptance of this potentially transformative technology. Measurement standards and performance metrics, specifically those that are relevant to industrial applications, are required to spur innovation and to hasten the adoption of these advanced technologies. © 2010 ACM.","3D; industrial; pose; range; robot; sensing","Competition; Industrial applications; Innovation; Intelligent systems; Manufacture; Robots; Sensors; Standardization; Technology; Three dimensional computer graphics; 3D; industrial; pose; range; sensing; Computer vision","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84871396942"

Creativity and innovative thinking are not easily taught in the classroom, but they can be developed through practice and experience. Evaluating innovation as part of product design courses has thus become very important to increase the probability of students becoming innovators in the real world. Innovation tournaments provide universities with an opportunity to develop innovative design thinking in students while they gain practical experience. Understanding design innovation at a deeper level in the context of student design projects is critical to develop realistic perspectives among students. Determining the appropriate dimensions for understanding and measuring innovation is the main objective of this paper. Toward that objective, we conducted initial experiments in conjunction with an innovation award to develop and assess innovation metrics. The results reveal several dimensions of innovation: differentiability, creativity, need satisfaction, and probability of commercial success emerged as key dimensions. This research also assesses the perception of innovation, contrasting the perceptions of judges from industry with the views of academically oriented judges.

There are many concept generation techniques that can assist a designer in the initial phases of design. Unfortunately, few studies have examined these techniques that can provide evidence to suggest which techniques should be preferred or how to implement them in an optimal way. This study systematically investigates the underlying factors of four common and well-documented techniques: brainsketching, gallery, 6-3-5, and C-sketch. These techniques are resolved into their key parameters, and a rigorous factorial experiment is performed to understand how the key parameters affect the outcomes of the techniques. The factors chosen for this study with undergraduate mechanical engineers include how concepts are displayed to participants (all are viewed at once or subsets are exchanged between participants, i.e., ""rotational viewing"") and the mode used to communicate ideas (written words only, sketches only, or a combination of written words and sketches). Four metrics are used to evaluate the data: quantity, quality, novelty, and variety. The data suggest that rotational viewing of sets of concepts described using sketches combined with words produces more ideas than having all concepts displayed in a ""gallery view"" form, but a gallery view results in more high quality concepts. These results suggest that a hybrid of methods should be used to maximize the quality and number of ideas. The study also shows that individuals gain a significant number of ideas from their teammates. Ideas, when shared, can foster new idea tracks, more complete layouts, and a diverse synthesis. Finally, as teams develop more concepts, the quality of the concepts improves. This result is a consequence of the team-sharing environment and, in conjunction with the quantity of ideas, validates the effectiveness of group idea generation. This finding suggests a way to go beyond the observation that some forms of brainstorming can actually hurt productivity. © 2011 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.","6-3-5; brainsketching; C-sketch; empirical study; gallery method; idea generation; ideation; innovation","6-3-5; Brainsketching; C-sketch; Empirical studies; Gallery method; Generation techniques; Idea generation; Ideation; Innovation; Keys parameters","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79952767025"

Although healthcare delivery organizations have been relatively less aggressive in adopting new technologies than other sectors, they have made notable progress in recent years. We report the preliminary results from a study, conducted in the USA, of the adoption processes and mechanisms of imaging technologies in the healthcare sector, in particular the example of Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). The study involved 219 hospitals and medical centers who responded to a research questionnaire. We found that one of the key barriers to the slow or non-adoption of such systems is the relationship of the perceived or actual benefits to the evaluation criteria of the organization and its members.

This approach uses a risk-based framework that simultaneously optimizes innovation attributes along with traditional project management and system engineering attributes. To demonstrate the efficacy of the new risk based approach, a comprehensive product development experiment was conducted. This experiment simultaneously managed the innovation risks and the product delivery risks through the proposed risk-based framework. Quantitative metrics for technology innovation were tracked and the experimental results indicate that the risk-based approach can simultaneously achieve both project deliverable and innovation objectives.","Innovation; Product development; Risk assessment; Technology management","Engineering research; Experiments; Product development; Project management; Risk assessment; Technology; Innovation attributes; Innovation risks; New product development; Product delivery; Project management practices; Quantitative metrics; Risk based approaches; Risk mitigation strategy; Risk-based; Risk-based approach; Technology innovation; Technology managements; Innovation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84871272033"

Success in such transitions has been mixed, as have findings on the role of performance measurement and management in the process. This study explores the challenges of managing this transition, with specific focus on the role of performance metrics. Conventional wisdom indicates that top management can use metrics - measures, standards and rewards - to communicate new directions and priorities. Based on findings reported in this paper, this approach is found to be potentially fatally flawed when applied to a situation where both the corporate goals and the means of achieving these goals have changed. Using detailed data drawn from a multi-level analysis of a major international corporation undertaking such a strategic shift, this study explores the process by which metrics are formed and deployed, and the impact of this process on the ability of the firm to successfully achieve the change. Using measures such as the percentage of sales from new products, top management in the case study had the impression that the strategy was being successfully carried out by the various operating divisions. However, radical innovation (the desired result) had been replaced by incremental innovation. This study identifies the reasons for this situation. A major finding is that the performance measurement and management system can both allow and conceal this failure. Firms trying to significantly change their strategic directions must change their selection of performance metrics to focus less on the intended outcomes and more on the means by which these outcomes are to be achieved. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.","","Incremental innovation; International corporation; Management systems; Multi-level analysis; New directions; New product; Operating divisions; Performance measurements; Performance metrics; Process management; Product innovation; Radical innovation; Strategic direction; Top management; industrial performance; innovation; leadership; management practice; performance assessment; planning process; strategic approach; Innovation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77955259197"

Object-oriented metrics have proven as indicators of problems in system design. They have been grouped in minimal sets, known as quality models, to assess object-oriented system quality. Improvement can be gained by establishing relationships between quality characteristics and metrics computed from object-oriented diagrams. Quality models include metrics that can produce better code in object-oriented systems. Code quality can also be gained with refactoring. Refactoring is used to reduce complexity and eliminate redundant code. It is important to identify when and where to use refactoring. There are many different approaches. This work presents early stage analysis and focuses on exploring whether object-oriented metrics can be used as indicators where in the code refactoring can be used.

First, wireless links are inherently lossy due to channel fading or interference. Second, the delivery condition of the route from the source to each receiver in a multicast transmission might be significantly distinct. Trying to satisfy the reliability requirement for the poorly-connected receivers may affect the performance of the rest of the receivers. In this paper, we present a tree-based multicast protocol, which exploits the characteristics of network coding to provide efficient and reliable multicast. A metric, named Receiving Probability (RP), is proposed to represent the probability for a node in a multicast tree to successfully receive a packet sent by the multicast source. To mitigate the distinctions among the receivers, the proposed multicast protocol aims to construct multiple trees such that the RP of each receiver satisfies a predefined threshold. Besides, since seldom redundant packets are generated with random network coding, by applying random network coding to these constructed multiple trees, differently coded packets can be transmitted on multiple trees, and the throughput of the reliable multicast can be improved. Simulation results show that the average throughput can be enhanced 30% and the throughput of the poorly-connected receivers can be enhanced 100% with our protocol, compared to a recent work. © 2010 IEEE.","Multiple trees; Network coding; Reliable multicast","Ad hoc networks; Information theory; Innovation; Multicasting; Throughput; Average throughput; Channel fading; Coded packet; Multicast protocol; Multicast transmissions; Multicast tree; Multicasts; Multiple trees; Network coding; Random network coding; Reliable Multicast; Simulation result; Tree-based; Wireless link; Network protocols","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78649866403"

Despite great strides in information technology, engineering design practice, and manufacturing production, the necessary process innovations that can produce products and systems with sufficient customization and economic efficiency have yet to be found in wide application. In this paper, the state-of-the-art in MC is explored in order to answer the question of ""why not?"" and to highlight areas for specific research in the MC paradigm. To establish perspective for this work, we consider MC to be a product development approach which allows for the production of goods - after a customer places an order - which minimize the tradeoff between the ideal product and the available product by fulfilling the needs and preferences of individuals functionally, emotionally and anthropologically. Results of this research were generated by reviewing 88 papers from various journals that span three domains of interest (marketing, engineering, and distribution) and explore proposed methodologies, specific information inputs and outputs, proposed metrics, and barriers toward the implementation of MC. Qualitatively, we show that the lack of MC in application is due to two factors: 1) a lack of marketing tools capable of capturing individual needs that can be mapped to the technical space; and 2) a lack of information relation mechanisms that connect the domains of marketing, engineering, and distribution. In the end it is our belief that MC is realizable and that eventually it will emerge as a dominant paradigm in the design and delivery of products and systems. However, pursuing the opportunities for research presented in this work will hopefully speed this emergence. © 2010 by ASME.","","Computer aided design; Engineering research; Information technology; Innovation; Marketing; Product development; Development approach; Economic efficiency; Engineering design; Marketing tools; Mass customization; Process Innovation; Specific information; Manufacture","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80054991855"

This is the reason so much emphasis is placed on bandwidth, sampling rate, and memory length. If the necessary signals are accurately acquired, any number of parameters can be extracted by the appropriate software tools. Some of these tools are built in such as the FFT and a suite of waveform measurements. Others, including jitter and compliance testing, usually are optional. Processing power and architecture vary greatly among scopes so the best way to evaluate one is with your actual application. Especially for measurements that involve statistics or complex events, long memories are essential. But beware: All that data has to be manipulated several times as measurement algorithms operate on it. If you need to work with long memories, develop some representative test suites with multichannel acquisition, math operations, and maybe a long FFT. Now see how quickly competing scope models execute the test sequence and display the results. Scopes are very complex instruments. Whether or not you consider one to have high performance depends on a large number of factors including control panel responsiveness and personal preference. The continuing innovation and increases in all the usual metrics of bandwidth, sampling rate, and memory length are impressive and support the advancement of a wide range of engineering disciplines. Nevertheless, high performance is defined by how well a scope addresses all aspects of your application, and only you can determine that.","","Computer software; Fast Fourier transforms; Innovation; Compliance testing; Control panels; Engineering disciplines; Large parts; Long memories; Measurement algorithms; Memory length; Multi-channel acquisition; Personal preferences; Processing power; Sampling rates; Software tool; Test sequence; Waveform measurement; Jitter","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77955360999"

The engineering economics factors and process variables that affect the profitability and resource efficiency of nickel recovery are identified. They are modeled in cost and efficiency metrics. Model-based scenarios assessment revealed that compared to open-loop nickel recovery, the closed-loop concept delivers more cost-effective and greener recycling solutions.

Operators in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico have found a similar service an invaluable resource when researching analog fields, as reservoir assessment and benchmarking are at the heart of good appraisal, sanction and development decisions. Through utilizing analogous data, decision makers can evaluate assumed data based on its statistical place in similar fields and geological regions. When analytics are performed in this manner, uncertainty risk can be reduced. The North Sea knowledge base features innovative applications, including a GIS interface and a set of analytical tools, and is maintained and supported by a team of engineers and geologists who provide analysis, case studies, and statistics on key data and fields. Directed towards exploration, appraisal and development teams in the North Sea area, the knowledge base contains coverage of all productive sands discovered, reservoirs either currently in production or sanctioned for development. The service provides regularly updated reservoir metrics and analogs, and offers a unique combination of reservoir engineering, geological, production, facilities and economic data analysis, together with regional knowledge. Users may also leverage the public domain information and analysis in the knowledge base by deploying secure servers in-house to store, manage, and compare proprietary data with the data and data analysis stream provided.

As technologies approach final products and applications, the number of criteria it must satisfy increases exponentially. Economics of the manufacturing process, environmental issues, intellectual property management, etc. needs to be assessed and monitored carefully. Bridging the gap from research to business needs multi-disciplinary understanding of the various aspects of the technology as well as what it could potentially enable in the market place and how to go about it through partnerships with global business entities. Especially with new materials, such as nano-scale materials, technology push needs to be rigorous and often the end results are uncertain. One needs to start from a large number of end user applications and narrow down to a couple of high value-add or high volume opportunities. Timing for such efforts is crucial and the resources needed for such activities are often under-estimated by small start-up firms. Even for materials with significant market pull, one requires huge investments for product reliability demonstrations, constant process development to reduce cost of manufacturing, etc. Innovation, flexibility, change, educated risk, adaptability, focus and excellence are all key drivers and necessary ingredients for a successful start-up company. While scientific and engineering innovations are absolutely necessary, the metric for success for any business is revenue generation. Finding the right mechanisms for closing this gap (so-called the valley of death) is where the innovations of entrepreneurs lies. In this paper, some of the personal learning experiences through the start-up company Applied Nanoworks Inc., (now Auterra Inc.) has been presented.

We use Clayton Christensen's innovation theory to frame the present work. We discuss two innovation trends - cloud computing and control/data plane separation - that are not likely to change the Internet architecture, and a new global communication network architecture under investigation - Information-centric Networking - that could. Our conclusion is that, based on the commercial forces that have driven the Internet's evolution since the mid-1990's, and absent a major change in the expected performance metric from customers, an innovative new global communication architecture different from the Internet is unlikely to be deployed. ©2010 IEEE.","Innovation; Integration; Internet; Modularization","Communication; Distributed computer systems; Modular construction; Clayton; Cloud computing; Global communication; Innovation theory; Innovation trends; Internet architecture; Internet infrastructure; Long term; Modularization; Modularizations; Next generation Internet; Performance metrices; Plane separation; Position papers; Internet","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77953892343"

Business research has attempted to link metrics of innovation to entrepreneurship. Educational research has not broached this connection. Research is somewhat split as to whether creativity and innovation are domain or disciplinary characteristics or traits or whether they can be measured in general form. Such research has not been focused on engineering or the sciences. Interestingly, both engineering and scientifically focused industries are expecting both innovative and entrepreneurial skills in their degreed employees. To meet the need of measuring whether engineering programs are inspiring and cultivating creativity and innovation (a recognized precursor of entrepreneurship,) I designed an engineering creativity and innovation index.

Many routing protocols utilize vehicular traffic information as a metric to determine optimal routing paths to transmit data in vehicular environment. Due to the difficulty as well as the enormous deployment costs of static nodes and the arduous effort to obtain non-real-time traffic information, the existing traffic information collection mechanisms could not provide the efficiency that is needed for the VANETs environment. In this paper, we present a novel collaborative real-time traffic information collection mechanism. It includes hybrid traffic information collection, road weight information dissemination, as well as the hybrid traffic geographic routing. The collaborative real-time traffic information collection mechanism effectively collects and disseminates real-time hybrid traffic information such as node density and network traffic load. In most VANET routing protocols, the network traffic load is always ignored and this action may cause network performance degradation in heavy-traffic load networks. In proposed hybrid traffic geographical routing, a forwarding node at a junction adaptively decides on a routing path based on the real-time hybrid traffic information. It consists of successions of road junctions to find the destination node for the data packet. Between two consecutive junctions on the path, geographical forwarding is used to select forwarding nodes on the road. Simulation results not only shows the proposed mechanism has the ability to collect real-time traffic information effectively with only slight control overhead, yet also has the ability to avoid from choosing an already congested path. Simulation results also show that the proposed mechanism outperforms routing protocols like GSR (Geographic Source Routing) and GyTAR (improved Greedy Traffic Aware Routing Protocol) in terms of average delivery ratio. © 2011 Global IT Research Inst.","Geographic Routing; real-time traffic information collection; VANET","Innovation; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Mobile ad hoc networks; Network performance; Roads and streets; Routing protocols; Congested paths; Control overhead; Data packet; Delivery ratio; Deployment costs; Destination nodes; Forwarding nodes; Geographic routing; Geographical forwarding; Geographical routing; Inter vehicle communications; Network traffic; Node density; Non-real-time traffic; Optimal routing; Performance degradation; Real-time traffic information; Road junction; Routing path; Simulation result; Source routing; Traffic aware; Traffic information; Traffic information collections; Traffic loads; Transmit data; VANET; Vehicular environments; Vehicular traffic; Information dissemination","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79955686053"

The introduction of electronic support technologies onto the battlefield is expected to improve SA by providing the right information, at the right time, and in the right format. In the cur rent paper, we report a systematic and innovative approach to the design of portable SA support systems (P-SASS) that combines the use of human and computer agent simulation, non-intrusive objective metrics and cognitive system engineering to assess the benefits of such systems to the tactical commander. The prototype of a P-SASS designed to improve positional SA is compared to the traditional map and radio communication procedure in a simulation involving subject matter experts (SMEs) and using Virtual Battle Space 2 within the Thales Battle Transformation Center. Dynamic measures of performance, SA probes, and usability questionnaires were used in order to assess the improvement in SA associated to the P-SASS. The results suggest that i) the P-SASS increased awareness of positioning; ii) participants' confidence in their own SA was well calibrated when using the system; iii) responsiveness seem to benefit from the use of the P-SASS. Furthermore, this study also provides usability insights into the cur rent design process, and validates a methodology that can serve various initiatives of SASS development and evaluation. © 2011 IEEE.","augmented cognition; cognitive system engineering; portable support system; situation awareness","Computer simulation; Decision making; Decision support systems; Innovation; Radio communication; Surveys; Systems engineering; Augmented cognition; Battle space; Cognitive system engineering; Computer agents; Design process; Electronic support; Innovative approaches; Measures of performance; Multi-perspective; Non-intrusive; Objective metrics; Operational environments; portable support system; Right information; situation awareness; Subject matter experts; Support systems; Cognitive systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79956094217"

We propose an approach for adapting the expert search process (choosing the right type of trace and the right expertise hypothesis) to the given topic of expertise, by relying on Linked Data metrics. In a gold standard-based experiment, we have shown that there is a significant positive correlation between the values of our metrics and the precision and recall of expert search.

The use of innovative technology enabled the formalization of design knowledge within international student teams as did the methods that were developed for students to store, share, and reuse information. Coaching methods were used by teaching staff to support distributed teams and evaluation work on relevant classes was carried out regularly to allow ongoing improvement of learning and teaching and show improvements in student learning. Major findings of the 5-year project include the requirement to overcome technological, pedagogical, and cultural issues for successful eLearning implementations. The DIDET Framework encapsulates all the conclusions relating to design engineering in a global context. Each of the principles for effective distributed design learning is shown along with relevant findings and suggested metrics.

Because security protocols among layers are lack of cooperation, system performance degrades due to security redundancy and furthermore causes system overloading. Therefore, the paper proposes a cross-layer design network security management (CLDNSM) to protect system security while improve system performance, such as CPU utilization. First, the multiple security-dimension quantification (MSDQ) metric is proposed to evaluate holistic system security. Then, the proposed CLDNSM aggregates system information from layers and uses it to obtain the optimal security settings of layers according to the MSDQ metric. The simulation results show that system performance will be improved without sacrificing security protect compared to OSI layered model by using CLDNSM. Finally, to adapt to dynamic environments, security constraints will be modified automatically in a limited range to avoid system overloads, the simulation results show that the system overloads are under control © 2011 Global IT Research Inst.","cracking year; Cross-Layer Design; security dimension; security quantification; security requirement","Computer simulation; Design; Industrial management; Innovation; Network layers; Network management; Network protocols; cracking year; Cross-Layer Design; security dimension; security quantification; security requirement; Network security","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79955695780"

Globally, nearly 2.77 billion metric tons (t) (3.05 billion st) of portland and hydraulic cement was produced in 2007. The concrete construction sector has a responsibility to take immediate action to reduce its environmental impacts, including the generation reduction of CO2. This responsibility also brings the opportunity to develop innovative technologies, including use of materials from Coal Combustion Products (CCP's). These newly developed activated fly ash based products leave virtually no carbon footprint. Updated cementitious binder technology eliminates approximately 0.9 t (1 st) of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere per ton of portland cement produced. These cements have been engineered for use in fast track concrete repairs and construction, conventional paving, walls and concrete block masonry, new construction and repair projects. Activated pozzolanic material cements and resulting products are comprised of up to 95 percent green sustainable industrial waste stream materials, primarily fly ash. They are manufactured via a low energy, powder blending process. Key to green cement development was creating a material matrix that has a very dense crystal structure. This green cement technology possesses excellent performance and durability characteristics, including high early strengths and 28-day strengths over 70 MPa (10,000 psi). Moreover, they can be placed effectively with ambient temperatures ranging from -1°C to 49°C (30°F to 120°F). © 2010 ASCE.","Carbon; Cement; Concrete pavements; Sustainable development","Ashes; Blending; Carbon dioxide; Coal ash; Coal combustion; Concrete blocks; Concrete construction; Concrete pavements; Construction industry; Crystal structure; Emission control; Environmental impact; Fly ash; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydraulics; Innovation; Materials; Planning; Portland cement; Pozzolan; Repair; Roads and streets; Sustainable development; Waste incineration; Activated fly ash; Active Ingredients; Ambient temperatures; Anthropogenic emissions; Carbon footprint; Cement technology; Cementitious binders; Coal combustion products; Concrete repairs; Excellent performance; Fast tracks; High early strength; Hydraulic cement; Industrial waste streams; Innovative technology; Low energies; Man-made materials; matrix; New constructions; Powder blending; Pozzolanic materials; Cement manufacture","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79251509901"

The impact of such analysis is that it is transforming business processes and driving strategic business decision making and business model transformations, all of which overshadow more traditional low level, siloed, tactical optimizations. Such analytics trends are driving shifts in the overall analytics ecosystem that includes data providers and aggregators, analytics technology and service providers, clients in different industries, partners, and other related communities, e.g., visualization providers, academia, open source development communities. in particular, we have observed the emergence of two new service entities in the overall ecosystem: ■ New forms of data services that aggregate and provide accesses to a wide range of public and private data by partnering with data providers, aggregators, and clients are emerging. We call such services ""Data as a Service (DaaS)"" in this paper. DaaS can leverage commonly managed Cloud and Web based infrastructure and tools as well as hosted and Web delivery models to offer rich set of data processing, management, and access services, in addition to in house implementations. ■ on top of DaaS, one can create high value analytics services that can boost productivity and create value for all. Such services may include Business Intelligence reporting, text analytics, and advanced analytics such as predictive modeling, all made in composable forms to allow for direct consumption, integration and customizations. We call such services ""Analytics as a Service (AaaS)"". DaaS and AaaS help to maximize value for the overall ecosystem by eliminating common costs and delivering high value data and analytics services. Their emergence is transforming the overall analytics ecosystem and forcing significant cost structure and productivity model shifts, i.e., where to cut cost and where to make money - two key metrics to a business model. As a result, they are driving the emergence of new business models across the overall analytics ecosystem. in this paper, we will analyze the major analytics ecosystem trends. We show that our analysis suggests that there is an analytics ecosystem transformation undergoing. The new ecosystem will increasingly leverage new forms of data and analytics services and roles, e.g., DaaS and AaaS, to maximize value for the overall ecosystem. Such ecosystem changes drive shifts in enterprise cost structures and productivity and value creation models and creates a force for business model innovation. We will describe an evolution of business models around the analytics ecosystem and highlight the emerging business models that are enabled by the new ecosystem, many of which have an open, collaboration, and co-developing spirit. We will also present several real-world case studies to illustrate how the new ecosystem can maximize value for all by implementing innovative business models. © 2011 IEEE.","Analytics; Analytics ecosystem; Business models","Costs; Data handling; Data visualization; Decision making; Industry; Innovation; Metadata; Productivity; User interfaces; Visualization; Access service; Analytics; Analytics ecosystem; Business model innovation; Business models; Business Process; Cost structure; Cross industry; Data services; Gain insight; Low level; New business models; New forms; New services; Open source development; Predictive modeling; Private data; Productivity model; Service provider; Strategic business; Unstructured data; Value creation; Value data; Web delivery; Web-based infrastructure; Ecosystems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80051949739"

One direction is in the extension of two-dimensional (2D) mesh-based tiled chip-multiprocessor architectures into three dimensions. In this paper, we focus on efficient routing algorithms for such 3D mesh networks. As in the case of 2D mesh networks, throughput and latency are important design metrics for routing algorithms. Existing routing algorithms suffer from either poor worst-case throughput (DOR [1], ROMM [3]) or poor latency (VAL [2]). Although the minimal routing algorithm O1TURN proposed in [4] already achieves near-optimal worst-case throughput for the 2D case, the optimality result does not extend to higher dimensions. For 3D and higher dimensional meshes, the worst-case throughput of O1TURN degrades tremendously. The main contribution of this paper is the design of a new oblivious routing algorithm for 3D mesh networks called Randomized Partially-Minimal (RPM) routing. RPM provably achieves optimal worst-case throughput for 3D meshes when the network radix k is even and within a factor of 1/k 2 of optimal worst-case throughput when k is odd. RPM also outperforms VAL, DOR, ROMM, and O1TURN in average-case throughput by 33.3%, 111%, 47%, and 30%, respectively when averaged over one million random traffic patterns on an 8×8×8 topology. Finally, whereas VAL achieves optimal worst-case throughput at a penalty factor of 2 in average latency over DOR, RPM achieves (near) optimal worst-case throughput with a much smaller factor of 1.33. In practice, the average latency of RPM is expected to be closer to minimal routing because 3D mesh networks are not expected to be symmetric in 3D chip designs. The number of available device layers is expected to be much less than the number of processor tiles that can be placed along an edge of a device layer. For practical asymmetric 3D mesh configurations, the average latency of RPM reduces to just a factor of 1.11 of DOR. © 2008 IEEE.","","Building materials; Design; Innovation; Integrated circuits; Magnetic storage; Optimization; Three dimensional; Throughput; 3D meshes; Average case; Chip architectures; Chip designs; Chip multi processors; Design metrics; Device layers; Higher dimensions; Mesh networks; New opportunities; Oblivious routing; Optimality; Penalty factors; Silicon integrations; Three dimensions; Three-dimensional (3D); Traffic patterns; Two-dimensional; Worst-case throughputs; Routing algorithms","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-62349087103"

Design/methodology/approach - A sample of 108 US and Canadian firms that are using knowledge management was surveyed to determine each firm's TKI. This measure includes both the degree of usage and the tacitness of the knowledge management method. Regression and correlation were used to statistically analyze the innovation and financial outcomes. Findings - Significant relationships were found between a firm's level of TKI and the firm's innovation performance. Less clear is the relationship between a higher TKI and financial measures. Research limitations/implications - This research gives managers a way to structure their use of knowledge management methodology and use of resources in a way that may maximize performance, either as stand alone systems or as part of the Balanced Scorecard. Practical implications - The use of this research could greatly reduce the uncomfortable gut feeling that many managers have in funding so-called soft tacit-based knowledge management systems rather than invest in easier to assess hardware systems. Originality/value - This pioneering research develops tacit knowledge as a measurable quantity and links this metric to firm performance.","Balanced scorecard; Innovation; Knowledge management; Knowledge management systems; Tacit knowledge","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-39749185551"

In the last step, when the overhead costs are already assigned to cost objects, which usually represent the individual products or services that the firm produces or provides, a comparison is often made between the firm and a benchmarking enterprise in the same industry in order to find an aid of making a decision of reducing cost. At the same time, it is well known out of the cost theory of the microeconomic theory that there must exist the minimum cost if outputs and all input prices are given and the minimum cost is defined as the cost function of the enterprise, while the outputs and inputs prices are variable. Obviously, it exist an inevitable relation between the two kinds of costs from the two methods. That is the two kinds of costs should be equal or approximation in the theoretical meaning. So we can find a new method to control cost.

This can result in hazards, accidents, schedule delays, and financial losses to contractors. Traditionally, this structure is fabricated at elevation using scaffolds; however, this approach is costly, time-consuming, and labour- intensive. We introduce a procedure for lifting a 600 metric ton structure that has been fabricated on the ground with a synchronous hydraulic jack-up system.

It deals with the notorious ""Valley of Death"" that slows or sinks the flow of items of technology at various stages of the R&D/Innovation (R&D/I) process. It suggests a systematic methodology for identifying and measuring the impacts, outputs, barriers, and facilitators encountered in the flow. Criteria trees are suggested for connecting stage outputs to the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) of the operating units, parent organizations, and other sponsors and clients served by the labs. Some examples of common barriers and facilitators are given, including: the over-focus of many Tech Transfer Offices on ""paper"" Intellectual Property (IP), such as patents and licenses vs. ""real"" outputs and impacts such as new products and applications of technology that are transferred to and adopted by the various types of potential users of the technology.

A committee of the Canadian Construction Innovation Council (CCIC) was established to measure the performance and competitiveness of the Canadian construction industry and to recommend suggestions for its improvement. A set of metrics and a data collection tool were developed to be used in data collection for construction performance benchmarking. To further refine this prototype benchmarking effort, case studies using the metrics and the tool were conducted with two large owner organizations, one in Ontario and one in New Brunswick. Data was collected for 22 projects in Ontario and 20 projects in New Brunswick. The results of the data collection experience are described, and the case study data is presented in the form of descriptive statistics. Comparison with data from the literature and comparison with CCIC pilot study data serve to place the results in context. Some observations and suggestions are offered based on these studies, including suggestions as to how to further a performance benchmarking effort on a national basis and observations on how researchers from across the country can collaborate in efforts to support the industry.","","Civil engineering; Competition; Construction industry; Data acquisition; Innovation; Total quality management; Construction innovations; Construction performance; Data collection tools; Data collections; Descriptive statistics; Ontario; Performance benchmarking; Pilot studies; Benchmarking","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-63049088452"

Once knowledge goods are disseminated, their cost and price tend towards zero. It is now obvious (as apparent in recent OECD policy documents) that commercial research and trade in intellectual property capture only a small fraction of open source knowledge, which is expanding even more rapidly than global markets. But for policy makers this poses the problem of how to assign stable and defensible value to free floating knowledge goods. Across the world, research universities have been positioned in a networked competition of institutions with globally mobile personnel and converging goals and organizational cultures. In rapid time global university ranking and the associated technologies of publication and citation ordering and counting have proved potent in arranging status, assigning value and shaping behaviours in higher education. We find that public goods are readily annexed to the longer-standing projects of producing university status and sustaining an imperial global geo-politics of knowledge. Here the relation between status production and free open source cultural production is not so much a contradiction as an antinomy. These issues are discussed in the light of the flourishing and fall of the lowland city-states of the Maya in Mesoamerica, a notable example of a status economy and of the interplay between status reproduction and cultural goods, a dynamic only partly nested in economic production. The article reviews the rankings technologies, led by the Shanghai Jiao Tong University research metrics, the global strategies of university executives, changing national policies on universities and research, and the aggregation of these effects in the emerging ‘arms race’ in investment in innovation. © 2009, SAGE Publications.

With point precisions and spacing of the order of a few centimetres, an enhanced quantitative element can now be added to geological fieldwork and analysis, opening up new lines of investigation at a variety of scales in all areas of field-based geology. Integration with metric imagery allows 3D photorealistic models to be created for interpretation, visualization and education. However, gaining meaningful results from lidar scans requires more than simply acquiring raw point data. Surveys require planning and, typically, a large amount of post-processing time. The contribution of this paper is to provide a more detailed insight into the technology, data collection and utilization techniques than is currently available. The paper focuses on the workflow for using lidar data, from the choice of field area and survey planning, to acquiring and processing data and, finally, extracting geologically useful data. Because manufacturer specifications for point precision are often optimistic - when applied to real-world outcrops, the error sources associated with lidar data, and the implications of them propagating through the processing chain, are also discussed.","","accuracy assessment; data acquisition; geology; innovation; laser; lidar; satellite data; three-dimensional modeling; visualization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-44349187463"

Previous studies of research centres (in this case with a multidisciplinary character) are rare - none for operations management were found - and to that purpose of the paper proposes (new) metrics in addition to the peer review. Design/methodology/approach - The rich data provided during the mid-term review provided input for the analysis. Findings - In general the analysis indicates that the centres gravitate towards consultancy, stimulated by criteria set by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. Consequently, setting the industrial agenda to improve the competitive position of the UK manufacturing industry rarely occurs. Furthermore, centres with a stronger research strategy and with motivated research staff did outperform others in attracting additional funding. A focus on specific sectors correlates with a negative impact on research output. Despite an increased responsiveness to industry and the concentration of motivated research staff, stronger management cultures at the centres and more collaborative efforts between the centres would benefit performance. Practical implications - Even though the metrics proved an important tool, the combination of quantitative analysis and peer review made it possible to arrive at these conclusions, possibly setting the scene for the new REF in 2015. The lessons learned from the review and the analysis might be beneficial for research centres in operations management. Originality/value - Since this type of study - the in-depth evaluation of the performance of research centres - has never been conducted before, it paves the way to a better understanding of research management in a national context. Implications of the study might exceed that of the domain of research into manufacturing technology and manufacturing management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Innovation; Manufacturing industries; Operations management; Research organizations","Management; Manufacture; Collaborative efforts; Competitive position; Concentration of; Design/methodology/approach; Engineering and physical sciences research councils; Innovative manufacturing; Lessons learned; Management culture; Manufacturing industries; Manufacturing management; Manufacturing technologies; Negative impacts; Operations management; Peer review; Quantitative analysis; Research centres; Research management; Research staff; Research strategy; Industrial research","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-75649130408"

But the Atlantic Test Range (ATR) at the U.S. Navy, Patuxent River Air Station (PAX) has a need for an ongoing, transparent assessment of the reliability and accuracy of its GPS system. While sausage and legislation may remain mysterious, this paper describes a rigorous, documented method used on a repeated basis to establish performance metrics using the best, rigorous methods of measurement science. The GPS group at ATR is charged with providing GPS data for a variety of vehicle test applications. In addition, and with the greatest challenge, it also provides the baseline calibration system for radar, theodolyte, IR, and laser tracking and ranging systems. While each of these tracking instruments has its own calibration method, GPS/INS technology provides an innovative method to verify accuracy under realistic, operational scenarios. All of these applications require performance metrics to make critical test plan design decisions and test performance evaluation. Consequently, the GPS team at ATR has established the GPS Accuracy and Reliability Assessment (GARA) project to develop these statistics and make them generally available and understandable. Prior to this program we have relied on vendor specifications which tend to be too optimistic for the real-world applications we address. Some of the main objectives for GARA are: • Establish performance metrics that are specific to the ATR range including its reference receiver network, specific GPS receivers, and that reflect ATR's best engineering and operations practices. • Develop an accuracy and reliability assessment process that is repeatable, automated, rigorous, and as transparent as possible. • Ensure the results are published broadly and easily available throughout ATR and its customer base.","","Calibration; Innovation; Navigation; Reliability analysis; Air stations; Baseline calibration; Calibration method; Customerbase; Design decisions; GPS data; GPS receivers; GPS/INS; Innovative method; Laser tracking; Methods of measurement; Operational scenario; Performance metrics; Ranging systems; Real-world application; Reliability assessments; Test performance; Test plan; Test range; U.S. Navy; Vehicle tests; Global positioning system","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77952167080"

Meter is the base of the Arabic poetry that has always been used as a criterion for classifying poets and judging the good poetry. For the poetic expression to be inspiring, it has to appeal to the collective social unconsciousness. Therefore, the vision of our ancestor critics sprang from controlling rules for the poetic process that takes into consideration the factors of interactive creative process. These factors include: the creative writer, the text and the addressee.

This perplexing duality has led companies to seek external collaborations to effectively deliver innovative products to market. External collaboration often leads to innovation at reduced research and development expenditure. This is especially true of companies which find the most authoritative entity (usually a company or even a person) to work with. Authoritativeness accelerates development and research-to-product transformation due to the inherent knowledge of the authoritative entity. This paper offers a novel approach to automatically determine the authoritativeness of entities for collaboration. This approach automatically discovers an authoritative entity in a domain of interest. The methodology presented utilizes web mining, text mining, and generation of an authoritativeness metric.

Conventional project performance metrics including the foundation work of PMI1 and their ongoing contributions is mainly about achieving specified objectives at a given time and within an agreed budget. In our approach, we followed a different direction in estimating how project performance can affect positively or negatively organizational capacities and generate proportional organizational impact. This in turn can be used to assess project performance from a different perspective. To estimate the organizational impact, one needs to identify the respective organizational capacities impacted by the project, establish a measurement system and measure the difference on each capacity before project starts and after project ends. We present a novel approach according to which projects should be also evaluated for the positive or negative ""organizational impact"" they create to both the performing and the recipient(s) organization(s). Our hypothesis is that apart from the classic financial gains or losses a project delivers, there is a further and deeper impact on the performing organization as well as to the recipient ones. We introduce this hypothesis and describe a framework to measure organizational impact created by a project in a study case.

Does the type of innovation make a difference? To answer these questions, the authors examine how breakthrough and incremental innovations affect three different facets of firm performance: normal profits, economic rents, and total firm risk. They argue that each of these metrics is of independent interest to shareholders and managers and that examining one without the others results in an incomplete picture of the true financial value of innovation. Using data on more than 20,000 new products from consumer packaged goods industries, the authors find that breakthrough innovation is associated with increases in both normal profits and economic rents and that, on average, each breakthrough innovation in the sample is associated with an increase in firm value of $4.2 million. Breakthrough innovation is also associated with increases in the risk of the innovating firm, but this higher risk is offset by above-normal stock returns. In contrast, incremental innovation is associated with increases in normal profits only and has no impact on economic rents or firm risk. © 2008, American Marketing Association.","Firm risk; Innovation; Marketing strategy; Marketing-finance interface; Shareholder value","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-41549153001"

The application of knowledge-by means of entrepreneurship and innovation, research and development, software and design, education and developing computer-related skills-is now recognized to be one of the key sources of growth in the global economy and of increased social coherency. To enhance productivity growth, to maintain competitiveness and address disparities and economic-societal mismatches, countries such as Romania should invest more and with higher efficiency and efficacy in building human capital in a more direct way by higher education institutions. Especially for countries with medium score on the scale given by the Human Development Index, the quality of education needs improvement in order to foreseen on the long turn high quality of the output indicators of innovation (innovative applications, indicators of intellectual property). Every goverment/central authority is concerned with finding the right tools to press on the formal education system in choosing the appropriate mechanism for conveying to the young people, future employees and employers such the entrepreneurial culture so, on long term they could reconfigure the traditional old-fashion links among academia, research institutes and industry companies, for both private and state-owned enterprises. The article's intention is to provide a way to assess the correlation between developing entrepreneurial spirit in the young generations through the formal education system and the highly competitive results from domestic innovation process. It is proposed a benchmarking exercise in which several variables (identified by the means of empirical evidence and the availability of statistical data) are studies into econometric models (of multiple regression type) to test the impact effects on the explained variables described as output innovation indicators. The research idea focuses on the various indicators related to the enterprise/domestic level, variables concerning public science/higher education, and industry/government areas as the main dimensions to trigger the golden 'knowledge triangle' of education, research and innovation in gaining relevance within nowadays Romanian economy and society. Based on the sample composed on several countries within the European Union, the following objectives were followed: investigating ways in which entrepreneurship related activities held developing closer between academia and industry, investigating about how entrepreneurial learning can promote the innovation culture. The constructed models based on some hypothesis are tested on the cross-country samples; the econometric models are run in the linear and logarithmic forms, then using two dummy variables-for the country's level for development and the registered lags in the influencing mechanism. The conclusions reached give information about the most influencing variables and a prioritization procedure for founding long-term financing strategies is proposed according to the previously obtained results.","Entrepreneurship; Higher education; Indicators; Innovation; Metrics; Multiple regressions","Application programs; Benchmarking; Education; Indicators (instruments); Industrial relations; Industry; Innovation; Knowledge management; Mathematical models; Research; Societies and institutions; Entrepreneurial cultures; Entrepreneurship; Higher education; Higher education institutions; Human development index; Metrics; Multiple regressions; Research and development; Economic and social effects","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84896290152"

It redefines the debate on deskilling which ran through the 1970s and 1980s by expanding the focus beyond simple job quality to issues of current policy interest, notably the contribution of skill to innovation and productivity. To map this kind of dynamism it is necessary to use a metric capable of capturing change over short periods. This is achieved by adding a third dimension, skill-intensity, to Spenner's classic definition of skill in terms of two loosely related constructs, worker autonomy/control and substantive job complexity. Data drawn from the first eight waves of HILDA are analysed to demonstrate that this metric is capable of capturing statistically significant change in the average skill content of jobs over much shorter periods than was possible with the metrics used in earlier decades. The broadly parallel aggregate trendlines for skill-intensity and autonomy/control suggest that these two dimensions are linked in the way Spenner suggests, even though major discrepancies appear between them in some industries and occupations.","Autonomy; Control; Deskilling; Employee discretion; Informal learning; Innovation; Job quality; Skill polarisation; Skill trends; Skill utilisation; Skill-intensity; Substantive task complexity; Workplace learning","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78650139143"

The whole innovation process is subdivided into five ratio groups, namely the description of the ability to perform innovation processes, the contribution margin of the new products, the review of the innovation project, the ability of using tools for the innovation process and the ability to predict future events in a SWOT analysis.

To plan organizational initiatives around innovation or to bolster innovation requires a firm grasp of the innovation process. Few organizations have transparently defined such a process. Based on the findings of an exploratory study of over 30 US and European companies that have robust innovation processes, this paper breaks down the innovation process into discrete stages: idea generation and mobilization, screening and advocacy, experimentation, commercialization, and diffusion and implementation. For each stage, context, outputs and critical ingredients are discussed. There are several common tensions and concerns at each stage, which are enumerated; industry examples are also given. Finally, strategies for and indicators of organizational success around innovation are discussed for each stage. Successful organizations will use an outlined innovation process to create a common framework for discussion and initiatives around the innovation process, and to establish metrics and goals for each stage of the innovation process. © 2011 eContent Management.","Competitive advantages; Innovation; Innovation processes; Organizational capabilities","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-76449115325"

Unfortunately, current PPM practices ignore or misconstrue the physics of project selection, especially in Stage-Gate systems. Current practices do not consider how funding levels affect the quality of project selection and they misalign upstream selection decisions with product development goals. This paper corrects these problems by modeling project selection with signal detection theory and Heiner's theory of decisionmaking under uncertainty. The new model shows executives how to balance the risk of missing good opportunities with the risk of funding bad projects. Additionally, for Stage- Gate system, the model provides new metrics for managing attrition rates and coordinating upstream decisions with downstream goals. Finally, the paper recommends metrics for identifying mistakes in product developments. Once identified, executives can fix processes and improve resource allocation. Together, the metrics provide executives with guidance and feedback that are lacking in current PPM practices.

Other business activities such as sales lend themselves to simpler measure such as Gross Revenues, whereas design efforts get lumped into the cost side of gross margin calculations. Applying this mindset to design metrics marginalizes Product Design efforts as cost centers, making them ripe for cost reduction, rather than measuring the impact Product Design activities have on the efforts of an enterprise to create value. Methods such as Design for Manufacturability and Design for Assembly focus primarily on reducing downstream product costs. Much of the investment in Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools and Product Data management (PDM) systems has been driven by promised reductions in the length and cost of the design cycle. Cost reductions of this sort lend themselves to facile instrumentation and are easier to account for on the corporate balance sheet. No widely accepted design metric accounts for the impact design efforts have on Corporate Performance. The Product Capital Model is a recently developed framework (Feland 2005) that provides metrics for assessing the impact of design on Corporate Performance. Product Social Capital, one class of metrics from the framework, may have potential as a leading indicator of future product sales. This could imply a causal relationship between good design and good business. This hypothesis is tested against cases from the consumer electronics industry and the automotive industry. Implications of the results are reviewed for their impact on design research and design practice.","Corporate performance; Design metrics; Product innovation; Social capital","Automotive industry; Commerce; Computer aided design; Consumer electronics; Cost accounting; Cost reduction; Economics; Electronics industry; Information management; Innovation; Machine design; Business activities; Causal relationships; Computer aided design tools; Corporate balance sheet; Corporate performance; Design activity; Design cycle; Design effort; Design for assembly; Design for manufacturability; Design metrics; Design practice; Design research; Design team; Gross margin; Gross revenue; Impact design; Innovative product; Leading indicators; Product cost; Product data management systems; Product innovation; Product sales; Revenue generation; Social capitals; Product design","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84862630316"

Fully expendable and partially reusable space transportation systems have been developed and put in operation that have not adequately achieved this need. Access to space is technically achievable, but presently very expensive and will remain so until there is a breakthrough in the way we do business. Since 1991 the national Space Propulsion Synergy Team (SPST) has reviewed and assessed the lessons learned from the major U.S. space programs of the past decades focusing on what has been learned from the assessment and control of Life Cycle Cost (LCC) from these systems. This paper presents the results of a selected number of studies and analyses that have been conducted by the SPST addressing the need, as well as the solutions, for improvement in LCC. The major emphasis of the SPST processes is on developing the space transportation system requirements first (up front). These requirements must include both the usual system flight performance requirements and also the system functional requirements, including the infrastructure on Earth's surface, in-space and on the Moon and Mars surfaces to determine LCC. This paper describes the development of specific innovative engineering and management approaches and processes. This includes a focus on flight hardware maturity for reliability, ground operations approaches, and business processes between contractor and government organizations. A major change in program/project cost control is being proposed by the SPST to achieve a sustainable space transportation system LCC - controlling cost as a program metric in addition to the existing practice of controlling performance and weight. Without a firm requirement and methodically structured cost control, it is unlikely that an affordable and sustainable space transportation system LCC will ever be achieved. © 2008 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.","","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Ground operations; Innovation; Life cycle; Military applications; Moon; Propulsion; Transportation; Business Process; Controlling costs; Cost controls; Earth's surface; Flight hardware; Flight performance; Functional requirement; Government organizations; Innovative engineering; Lifecycle costs; Reusable space transportation systems; Space programs; Space propulsions; Space Transportation System; Space transportations; Earth (planet)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77957836732"

This innovation identified new potential for enhancing crew safety of the Orion vehicle through the adaptation of techniques pioneered for military aircraft survivability. The benefit of this approach became apparent in early applications as vehicle evolution trade studies were undertaken when new advantages of potential designs were identified through the study of design options through SCS and considered in the trade study decisions. Three years after the award, Spacecraft Vulnerability Reduction (SVR) has grown from a concept to an application. Where only System Reliability, Crew Survival and System Safety were applied, SVR brings further closure of gaps to prevent loss of life for potential mishap scenarios by complementing but not duplicating efforts in System Safety, Reliability, and Crew Survival and providing a more comprehensive design and assessment approach. This innovation has been embraced by the aircraft survivability world with recent developments for potential collaboration of efforts. These techniques must be developed and applied to space design, now, in order to support human missions to Mars. The example set by military aircraft programs teaches the road to developing and implementing a structured survivability program is long and could take decades to mature. Collaborative work has begun with the Naval Post Graduate College and NASA in efforts to gain expertise and expand what is traditionally done for spacecraft safety by applying new techniques to support design survivability decisions, drive designs through new survivability requirements, and measure the effectiveness of these techniques through a new system metric. This paper describes the program as envisioned and currently implemented, the achieved and projected benefits to the NASA project Orion, and insight into the future of Survivability and potential benefits beyond Orion to other human and uncrewed space applications where common concerns such as optimizing safety while minimizing weight are priority concerns. Work being performed now includes the Damage Modes and Effects Analysis (DMEA) and Methodology Document written for Spacecraft application, Emergency Return Mode application to affect design and operational scenario development, additional robustness to lowered fault tolerance systems, and program development. The DMEA follows the widely know Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA). Where the FMEA identifies the possible failures and hazards, the DMEA plays through the failures and analyzes the damage and its cascading events. To this day, safety requirements only look at the susceptibility: ""how likely is it to happen?"", and design only to prevent occurrence to a certain level of reliability. SVR is the practice of assuming the hazard has occurred. What then? By identifying these vulnerabilities during the design phase, LM is able to create a safer spacecraft, while having positive impacts on budget and schedule. This paper will propose the potential future of survivability driven design to strengthen the synergy between aircraft and spacecraft as we prepare for the moon, Mars and beyond.

This device is based on electrical detection of protein biomarkers wherein an immunoassay is built onto the iridium oxide nanowires that in turn undergoes specific electrical parameter perturbations during each binding event associated with the immunoassay. Detection of two inflammatory proteins C-reactive protein (CRP) and Myeloperoxidase (MPO) that are biomarkers of cardiovascular diseases is demonstrated. The performance metrics of the device in response to the two biomarkers in pure form and in serum samples were evaluated and compared to standard ELISA assays. The methodology that has been adopted is based on measuring impedance and calibrating its change in magnitude with concentration of proteins. We demonstrate the following performance metrics: limits of detection up to 1 ng/ml for CRP and 500 pg/ml for MPO in pure and serum samples; linear dynamic range of detection from 10 ng/ml to 100 μg/ml for CRP and 1 ng/ml to 1 μg/ml for MPO and cross-reactivity contained at less than 10% of selective binding for both the inflammatory proteins.

While these economic indicators provide an appreciation of the level of economic activity due to construction, they do not provide an understanding of the performance of the construction industry. Recently, benchmarking has been used as a method of measuring and improving the performance of construction organizations and projects. Benchmarking in construction is predominated by the use of project level metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs); and has been pioneered by the United Kingdom and the United States. In addition to benchmarking, maturity modeling has been used in construction at the organizational level and to a lesser extent, at the industrial level. Maturity modeling has its genesis in the software manufacturing industry and is based on Deming's concept of process improvement. This paper reports on the development of an innovative construction performance measurement framework comprised of a benchmarking model and a maturity model. The former provides an indication of project performance whereas the latter provides an indication of maturity with respect to construction industry practices. The framework is based on the premise that the maturity of construction industry practices will both directly and indirectly affect project performance. The main objective of the performance measurement framework is to provide both an indication of performance as well as a context in which to interpret performance.","","Civil engineering; Construction industry; Economics; Innovation; Benchmarking models; Construction organizations; Construction performance; Economic activities; Economic indicators; Key performance indicators; Manufacturing industries; Maturity models; Organizational levels; Performance measurement frameworks; Process improvements; Project levels; Project performance; United kingdoms; Benchmarking","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-63049097180"

Changes in forest structure resulting from defoliation, windthrow, and salvage harvesting may increase snow accumulation and ablation (i.e., spring runoff and flooding risk) below the forest canopy because of reduced snow interception and higher levels of radiation reaching the surface. Quantifying these effects requires a better understanding of the link between forest structure and snow processes. Light detection and ranging (lidar) is an innovative technology capable of estimating forest structure metrics in a detailed, three-dimensional approach not easily obtained from manual measurements. While a number of previous studies have shown that increased snow accumulation and ablation occur as forest cover decreases, the potential improvement of these relationships based on lidar metrics has not been quantified. We investigated the correlation between lidar-derived and ground-based traditional canopy metrics with snow accumulation and ablation indicators, demonstrating that a lidar-derived forest cover parameter was the strongest predictor of peak snow accumulation (r2 = 0.70, p < 0.001) and maximum snow ablation rate (r2 = 0.59, p < 0.01). Improving our ability to quantify changes in forest structure in extensive areas will assist in developing more robust models of watershed processes.","","Forest Canopy; Forestry; Forests; Harvesting; Innovation; Land; Pinus; Radar; Salvage; Snow; Water Resources; Water Sheds; British Columbia; Canada; Coleoptera; Pinus contorta; Pinus mugo; Ablation; Innovation; Landforms; Optical radar; Snow; Water resources; British Columbia; Forest canopies; Forest cover; Forest structure; Ground based; Innovative technology; Light detection and ranging; Lodgepole pine forests; Mountain pine beetle; Potential impacts; Robust models; Salvage harvesting; Snow ablation; Snow accumulation; Watershed process; Windthrows; ablation; beetle; coniferous forest; defoliation; forest cover; forest dynamics; ground-based measurement; harvesting; interception; lidar; snow accumulation; stand structure; water resource; watershed; windthrow; Forestry","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77951668908"

But they often fail to actively monitor their performance on this metric relative to their peers. Furthermore, many executives do not understand how innovation is critical to driving margins as well as growth. Tracking a company's Innovation Quotient, enables executives to assess how they are doing versus competitors in successfully developing new products and services. Examining a company's development pipeline enables executives to forecast their future Innovation Quotient and provides insights into the future performance of the business. Design/methodology/approach: In this article, Jackson considers a number of case examples of businesses that actively monitor their innovation performance and use it as an indicator of future success and value creation. Examples industries cited in the article include consumer products, electronics, industrial products and investment banking. The author then draws lessons that can be applied broadly across any business seeking to improve future growth and profitability through greater innovation. Findings: Companies should proactively monitor their relative innovation performance compared to competitors using the Innovation Quotient metric. Measuring and monitoring a company's innovation rate and Corporate IQ can help management teams to take the tough choices, and build value for the long term when faced with the pressures of day to day performance. The companies that do the best job of building innovation capabilities and a strong development pipeline in tough times will be rewarded by even higher growth and margins when economic conditions improve.

Both the original designer and those reverse engineering the original design can benefit from estimating the time and barrier to reverse engineer a product. This paper presents a set of metrics and parameters that can be used to calculate the barrier to reverse engineer any product as well as the time required to do so. To the original designer, these numerical representations of the barrier and time can be used to strategically identify and improve product characteristics so as to increase the difficulty and time to reverse engineer them. As the metrics and parameters developed in this paper are quantitative in nature, they can also be used in conjunction with numerical optimization techniques, thereby enabling products to be developed with a maximum reverse engineering barrier and time - at a minimum development cost. On the other hand, these quantitative measures enable competitors who reverse engineer original designs to focus their efforts on products that will result in the greatest return on investment.

This is now part of a philosophy called Speed, which created over $23 billion in value between 1992 and 2008 for PO&E. The steps for this part of Speed are: 1) measuring and increasing the Creativity Index of the R&D leadership culture, which is genetic to a surprising degree; 2) Increasing the fit of leaders in specific jobs (Starters and Finishers); 3) Identifying, training and coaching creative Rainmakers as Business Opportunity Analysis, who routinely ""morph"" starling ideas into winners using a non-linear New Business Development (NBD) process; 4) Ensuring enough Finishers are present in the working groups to complete the projects; 5) Making sure management implements the positive findings. The five steps also present five new forward-looking R&D metrics that provide a clear and actionable game plan to create a winning R&D culture with 84% 95% success rates vs. the 11% rates that are typical after completing the early stages of NBD.","Corporate culture; Genetic creativity; New business development; Radical innovation; Rainmaker index","Engineering research; Corporate culture; Genetic creativity; New business development; Radical innovation; Rainmaker index; Innovation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-61349174626"

The former are referred to in the economic literature as General Purpose Technologies (GPTs). Using patent data I conclude that nanotechnologies show one of the main characteristics of a GPT, high Generality, and I show the progression of their generality over the time period 1980-2008. A metric for generality is applied to compare nanotechnologies with other technologies previously identified as GPTs. The measurements show that 'Nanotechnologies' have a higher average Generality than semiconductors, and that the level of Generality of nanotechnologies has remained fairly constant for more than two decades. Technologies such as 'Carbon Nanotubes', and 'Nanoparticles' have a higher Generality than 'Quantum Dots'. 'Self-assembly' appears to have transformed from a focused technology to a general purpose one. The choice of classification system used to calculate the Generality is relevant for the analysis of time trends. A high level of Generality in nanotechnologies is important to nanotech-intensive firms because it translates into a larger potential range of applications of their innovations. On the other hand, it also increases the possibility of competition from rivals that were previously developing focused technologies.","","Carbon nanotubes; Economics; Innovation; Nanotechnology; Patents and inventions; Semiconductor quantum dots; Classification system; Economic activities; Economic implications; General purpose; General purpose technologies; Main characteristics; Potential range; Quantum Dot; Time periods; Time trends; Technology","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-76649116274"

In this study we analyze forward citations for three classes of technology - biotechnology, telecommunications and alternative energy. We use patent metrics to measure the rate of technological innovation. Following the existing literature, we examine the incremental advances in the three selected technological fields as indicated by forward patent citations. Our initial proposition is that forward citations should follow a classic S-curve distribution. The paper examines this proposition. Our study entails: selecting groups of patents issued at least 20 years, and some as far as 30 years ago; extracting the number of forward citations issued each year for each patent through 2008; and fitting the cumulative forward citations to a variety of models such S-, linear, quadratic and logistic curves.

It is important, on the one hand, to determine the individual stake companies have in these issues and, on the other, to measure companies' performance. Since the results of studies thus far have been ambiguous, we define four comprehensive and systematic corporate carbon performance indicators: (1) Carbon intensity is physically oriented and represents a company's carbon use in relation to a business metric. (2) Carbon dependency illustrates the change in physical carbon performance within a given time period. (3) Carbon exposure reveals the financial implications of using and emitting carbon. (4) Carbon risk estimates the change in financial implications of carbon usage within a given time period. On the basis of these general definitions, we specify the indicators for a standardized application that can support two important stakeholders in their decision making: policy makers, who can include such information when evaluating current climate policies and formulating future ones, and investors and financial institutions, which can compare companies with respect to their carbon performance and corresponding financial effects. © 2008 by Yale University.","Carbon management; Climate change; Environmental indicator; Fossil fuel; Greenhouse gases (GHGs); Industrial ecology","Climate change; Climatology; Finance; Fossil fuels; Gases; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Innovation; Ketones; Problem solving; Public policy; Technological forecasting; climate change; decision making; environmental policy; financial provision; greenhouse gas; innovation; performance assessment; policy making; risk assessment; stakeholder; technological development; 21st centuries; Carbon intensities; Carbon management; Carbon performances; Climate policies; Energy sources; Environmental indicator; Financial effects; Financial implications; Financial institutions; Industrial ecology; Material flows; One hands; Policy makers; Technological innovations; Time periods; Carbon","Review","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-56749180955"

New bedding market entrant Tempur-Pedic continues to enjoy phenomenal growth and the industry's best profit margins founded on viscoelastic foam technology innovated by NASA. Visco mattress innovations are clearly disrupting the mattress industry as evidenced by several management, market, and financial metrics. However, visco mattress innovations cannot be classified as a disruptive innovation (DI) because the popularized term as commonly accepted and practiced requires that a DI cannot be used by mainstream users. Visco mattress innovations can be used by mainstream mattress users. Technology management researchers and practitioners may miss significant opportunities by rejecting potential innovations that would disrupt incumbent competitors and markets because they do not fit their current conceptual requirements for DIs such as that they cannot be used by mainstream users. Therefore, for this essay, a visco mattress innovation is characterized as a radical-disruptive innovation (RDI) with most characteristics of both radical and disruptive innovations in that it: (1) uniquely delivers new customer-demanded benefits useful even to mainstream users, (2) requires new organizational core competencies relative to the incumbent firms, and (3) disrupts the business models and markets of incumbent firms. This essay explores some of the management/organizational behaviors and market dynamics associated with the continuing disruption of the mattress industry by visco foam mattress RDIs. In addition, this essay briefly explores the managerial and financial constraints that LBO owners place on their firms that: help to allow a new firm with an RDI to enter the incumbent market and successfully compete, as well as mitigate the success of the new market entrant, both as the result of low organizational/financial slack. In conclusion, it is expected that Tempur-Pedic will continue to outperform innerspring incumbents by executing their current successful business model based on viscoelastic foam RDIs, albeit at slower rates. Also, it is expected that visco foam RDIs will become ubiquitous in the bedding and other industries, particularly in the high margin healthcare and sports industries, which is beneficial to all. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

It is to build a wide path from research and development to commercialization by involving the right people, processes and metrics. In Googol's experience, a vast majority of companies face the largest challenges in the gap between development and commercialization. By thoroughly understanding the innovation route - Research-Development- Commercialization-Market Entry (RDCM) - and by effectively addressing the Development-Commercialization gap, the holy grail of innovation is within reach. The difference in ""Share of Commercialized Patents"" (SCP) varies between organizations and nations. The discrepancy between two nations has been shown to be as far as 75% versus 12%, which is partly a result of patent strategies, but also of the methodology or even lack of structured Innovation Systems. The higher the level of entrepreneurial activities and the earlier the involvement from commercial specialists, the higher the outcome of R&D to repetitively commercialized products and services. Googol's experience from working with a large number of global blue-chip companies has shown that the route from research to commercial breakthrough faces thresholds that can be anticipated and proactively managed - thus controlling risk and enhancing returns to a higher extent. The condensed explanation of how Technology Transfer Systems can be successfully shaped is to build and develop the Innovation Value Chain™ (ICV). The ICV encompasses challenges and solutions that range from organization to product &services, to social structures. Focusing on the Opportunity Epicentre, we suggest adding resources in terms of optimized financial support*, competencies and management focus, and also actively working with methodologies such as Open Innovation, Metrics, and Internal Corporate Venturing. A properly implemented Innovation Value Chain™ assists in developing ideas from a stand-alone position with a fixed commercial value of 100 points to a market-ready solution with an earned commercial and strategic value of 18.600 points. We refer to this as the ""Holy Grail of Innovation"" - when the Opportunity Epicentre has been widened to allow products and solutions to successfully journey from Research to Market.","","Commerce; Innovation; Occupational risks; Research; Technology transfer; Chip companies; Corporate venturing; Entrepreneurial activity; Epicentre; Financial support; Innovation system; Market entry; On currents; Open innovation; Patent strategy; Products and services; Research and development; Social structure; Stand -alone; Strategic values; Transfer systems; Value chains; Patents and inventions","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78049370410"

The Canadian airport industry, for example, is growing 5% annually and generates about $8 billion yearly. In 2002, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) put into force revised Aviation Security standards and recommended practices and started a Universal Security Audit Program (USAP) to examine the compliance of airports worldwide. Although the USAP's reports highlight defects and recommend rectifying actions, they do not include quantitative assessments or provide improvement (upgrading) guidelines. This creates a decision challenge for airport officials with respect to determining the status of their security systems and efficiently allocating the financial resources to improve them. A new quantitative security metric based on the USAP's Security Audit Reference Manual, is presented in this paper. The aim of the metric is to assist airports' authorities to self-assess their security systems' conditions and be more prepared for ICAO's audit visit. Ultimately, the metric will produce a security index which decision makers can utilize as a prioritizing criterion in their decision making strategies. Currently, the authors are integrating these quantitative measures into an automated decision support system for upgrading security systems at both single and multiple airport levels.","","Artificial intelligence; Aviation; Civil engineering; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Distillation; Innovation; Regulatory compliance; Security systems; Airport industries; Aviation securities; Decision makers; Decision supports; Decision-making strategies; Dynamic infrastructures; Financial resources; International civil aviation organizations; Quantitative assessments; Quantitative measures; Recommended practices; Security audits; Security indices; Security metric; Airports","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-63049089531"

We discuss the details of how scatterometry provides in-line metrology solution to measure key features of the eSiGe structure. Critical features to measure are eSiGe to gate proximity and the unetched silicon on insulator (SOI) thickness. The proximity measurement is particularly vital because it has a major influence on device performance, yet there was no high throughput in-line metrology solution until scatterometry. Results from multiple scatterometry platforms (three) are presented along with a summary of various metrology performance metrics like precision and accuracy. We also show how scatterometry measurements have been instrumental in supporting process development efforts. The comparison of scatterometry measurements to reference data from multiple metrology techniques is presented in order to evaluate the accuracy performance of various supplier platforms. Reference metrology techniques used are thin-film measurements from un-patterned targets, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and cross-section scanning electron microscopy (XSEM). Tool matching uncertainty (TMU) analysis and weighted reference measurement system (wRMS) technique have been utilized to assist in the interpretation of correlation data. Scatterometry results from various wafers that were generated to modulate spacer width and etch cavity are also presented.

Innovation, as it relates to the physical, process, organizational/contractual, and financial/revenue dimensions of a project, has a central role to play in not only contributing to the requirements set for a wide variety of project performance metrics but also improving upon them. Proposed in this paper is a theory in the form of a set of factors (drivers/inhibitors to innovation) and related state values that influence the potential for the identification and adoption of innovations that improve project efficiency or offer increased value. This theory is embedded in a supporting assessment framework to assist with selecting and structuring a project's procurement mode to enhance the innovation potential of a project from the perspective of a government agency tasked with such decisions. The framework was developed in response to a lack of tools to help practitioners with tasks relating to innovation assessment, especially in regard to conducting a public sector comparator analysis when a public-private partnership procurement mode is being considered among others; and aligning terms and conditions in bid documents, requests for proposals, and concession agreements in a way that fosters beneficial innovations to the extent that factor states can be controlled. The framework provides the project evaluation process with a means of assessing project innovation potential at the very front end of the procurement mode selection process, and is meant to be comprehensive yet simple and easy to use in practice. It can also be used by researchers to help analyze on a postproject basis reasons why innovations were or were not adopted for a specific project context. The framework is applied to case studies on two infrastructure projects in Scandinavia and the United States to demonstrate its application and to assess the role that choice of procurement mode had in influencing the innovations used. © 2008 ASCE.","Infrastructure; Innovation; Partnership; Procurement","Finance; Investments; Project management; Set theory; Technology; (2+1) dimensions; (e ,2e) theory; (e ,3e) process; (I ,J) conditions; Applied (CO); budget constraints; capital investments; case studies; Critical issues; Front end; Government agencies; infrastructure projects; innovation assessment; Mode selections; Project efficiency; Project evaluation; Project performance; public sectors; Public/ private partnership (PPP); Safety concerns; Scandinavia; United States; Innovation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-45749137615"

As creativity has become a major requirement for designers and engineers in the 21 st century, these and other related metrics could play an important part in the success of companies. Innovative products provide companies with a competitive advantage in the market as well as stimulating the economy. Creativity metrics will enable them to choose the more innovative designs in the beginning stages of concept design, reducing time and cost associated with implementation of designs that are not creative or innovative.

Findings - Findings suggest that an innovation culture scale may best be represented through a structure that consists of seven factors identified as innovation propensity, organizational constituency, organizational learning, creativity and empowerment, market orientation, value orientation, and implementation context. Practical implications - The seven-factor model can be used both descriptively and diagnostically. Among other things, it presents a practical way to measure an organization's innovation culture, and could initially be used to establish a baseline level of innovation culture. From there, it could be used as a metric to chart the organization's efforts as it moves to engender innovation. Originality/value - More effort should be devoted to developing measures to assess innovation culture specifically. This model presents an innovation culture construct that is complimentary to work that has preceded it. The findings combined with the suggestions provide an alternative perspective as a measure of innovation and extends a basic framework for further investigation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Innovation; Measurement; Organizational culture","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-53349100304"

Within a constmctivist pedagocical aproach Moodle (Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment) [1], a very popular Learning Management Systema (LMS), provides a highly configurable web-based interface that includes a wide range of activities which are, in general, sufficient for a standard course. Nevertheless, when dealing with specific subjects, some functional features are missed, as it is the case when teaching a basic course on computer architecture, an essential topic in the computer science curricula. It involves practical assignments consisting on the design and simulation of elementary processors by means of CAD tools making use of schematic or VHDL design entries. Currently the University of Malaga is making an increasing effort oriented to the successfull implementation of the ECTS (European Credit Transfer System) system. This involves changing the teaching practices carried out traditionally [2], looking towards the developing of assessment mechanisms in order to increase the student's active effort. In our course, in order to better guide the students, teachers should perform a functional evaluation using a simulation tool to verify whether the students' designs work or not according to the specifications. This is a very time consuming task, becoming a common bottleneck when looking for a continuous assessment of students. One key element of the new CTpractices module is the automatic checking and verification engine that keeps information about the current state of students work, supplying automatic assessment features and feedback to the student. Teachers can modify the project description and define different testing benches. The module stores historical information concerning the results of the different evaluations, extracting statistics and metrics which are very useful when determining the student workload in the context of the ETS model. Additionally, this new module is oriented to promote a collaborative teamwork allowing to define student teams in a more operative way than built-in moodle groups. Other basic aspects supported are material repository, deadlines, hosting, etc. The new module inherits a part of its functionality from a specific LMS previously developed by the authors, that has been in use from academic year 2004 [3], widely proving its usefulness. It has been re-designed according to the Moodle philosophy, making possible to easily extend its application to other similar subjects. The choice for Moodle is motivated by its modular organization based on free software like PHP and MySQL. From the developer point of view, this allows to add new modules using well-known interfaces. As Moodle is currently used by the Virtual Campus of our university, this new module breaks the isolation of the previous platform as refers to activities like forums, messages or event signaling.","Automatic assessment; Computer architecture; Lms; Moodle","Computer aided design; Computer architecture; Computer science; Computer systems; Computers; Curricula; Education; Education computing; Feedback; Innovation; Multimedia systems; Philosophical aspects; State feedback; Students; Virtual reality; And verifications; Assessment mechanisms; Automatic assessment; Automatic assessments; Basic courses; CAD tools; Computer organization courses; Configurable; Current states; Design and simulations; Dynamic learnings; European credit transfer systems; Free softwares; Functional evaluations; Functional features; Historical informations; Key elements; Learning managements; Lms; Modular organizations; Moodle; Object-oriented; Simulation tools; Student teams; Testing benches; Time consuming; Virtual campuses; Teaching","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-57349089273"

Both groups of students were presented with the same design challenge, and pre-established metrics were used to characterize the novelty and variety of the resultant designs generated by the students. The designs from the biologically-inspired design students had an average novelty score 80% higher than those from the control group of capstone students, and the result was statistically- significant. The biologically-inspired design students also had a 37% higher average variety score, although a small sample size led to a high variance and prevented statistical significance. The increased scores for novelty and variety imply a greater tendency toward innovative design among the biologically-inspired design students. The source of greater innovation is unclear but may be due to improved analogical reasoning capabilities among the biologically-inspired design students. © 2009 IEEE.","Design; Entrepreneurship; Ideation; Innovation","Curricula; Design; Engineering education; Mechanical engineering; Teaching; Analogical reasoning; Capstone design; Control groups; Design challenges; Entrepreneurship; Innovative design; Mechanical engineering students; Small Sample Size; Statistical significance; Students","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77951437014"

Design/methodology/approach: Hypothesized relationships are tested using confirmatory factor analysis and hierarchical linear regression models. Findings: It was found that internal coordination capability and supplier involvement effort have a positive effect on collaborative product development (CPD) performance. In addition, internal coordination capability positively moderates the relationship between supplier involvement and CPD performance. Research limitations/implications: The study used targets or goals as the standard for measuring all scales in CPD performance. Although, this approach has several advantages and it is widely reported in the literature, it fails to account for the aggressiveness of the goals or targets as well as relative importance of the metrics. Practical implications: Managers attempting to gain short-term benefits through increased collaboration scope will risk negative CPD performance unless they are willing to invest significant effort in supplier involvement to reduce the transaction cost. Originality/value: Unlike existing literature which focuses either on internal integration or external integration, this study focuses on their interaction.

Data from ten company case studies demonstrate the utility of the proposed metrics and exemplify how different PDPs manage different risks. The cases also show that software companies face different risks and employ more flexible PDPs than manufacturing companies.

In which software development life cycle involves a sequence of different activities during the development process. . Risk analysis helps to avoid the adaptive reusability problem for transformation of coding. Its main feature is that it encourages the concept of reusability which paves the way for use of functions and packages. Code development is generally based on the pattern of design. Therefore reusable component is introduced to reduce the risk factors in projects. Risk is directly proportional to the complexity of a system and risk is inversely proportional to the number of reusable components used in a project. Software organizations always focus on improving technology so as to reduce overheads in people management, increase customer satisfaction, cutting short in time and cost of productions etc., Reusability is motivated to reduce time and cost in software development.","Risk reduction; Software components; Software package; Software people; Software project environment; Software reuse","Cost reduction; Customer satisfaction; Innovation; Reusability; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Safety factor; Software design; Software packages; Code development; Cost of productions; Development process; People management; Quality software; Reusability problem; Reusable components; Risk factors; Risk reduction; Risk reductions; Software development; Software development life cycle; Software organization; Software project; Software Re-use; Computer software reusability","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77952359390"

The interactive genetic algorithm combines computable user interface design metrics with subjective user input to guide evolution. Individuals in our population represent interface specifications and we compute an individual's fitness from a weighted combination of user input and user interface design guidelines. Results from our preliminary study involving three users indicate that users are able to effectively bias evolution towards user Interface designs that reflect both user preferences and computed guideline metrics. Furthermore, we can reduce fatigue, defined by the number of choices needing to be made by the human designer, by doing two things. First, asking the user to pick just two (the best and worst) user interfaces from among a subset of nine shown. Second, asking the user to make the choice once every t generations, instead of every single generation. Our goal is to provide interface designers with an interactive tool that can be used to explore innovation and creativity in the design space of user interfaces. © 2007 IEEE.","","Genetic algorithms; Innovation; Problem solving; Specifications; Interface definition languages; Interface designers; Interface specifications; User interfaces","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-70049110721"

As a result, PLoS ONE has taken elements of the traditional publishing model for scholarly journals and separated them into those functions that are most effectively carried out before publication (for example, peer review in order to evaluate whether the article deserves to join the scientific literature) and those that can most effectively be carried out after publication (for example, how impactful the article was once it joined the literature). With this basic premise in place, and using the online tools that are now available, the journal has grown to the extent that in 2009 it will become one of the largest journals in the world (by publication volume). This article overviews the development of the journal to date - how it differs from most other journals and how it engages with its core audiences. In March 2009, the journal (along with other PLoS titles) began a program to place 'article-level metrics' on each publication, and this article outlines how this has been achieved, as well as plans for further development.

It can be argued that those authorities that successfully embed this change will attract new business and employment, increase loyalty, pull in more tax revenue and increase their reputation; a virtuous circle. Given the relative newness of government reputation theory, government leaders have lacked suitable strategies and techniques to apply in their organisations. As part of a UK national programme, sponsored by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, a study was undertaken of successful, leading local authorities. The study established that government leaders should put together a reputation strategy of two interwoven dimensions.

This study analyses how the variable 'space' affects an important activity carried out within these laboratories: the technological transfer. The purpose of this research is to: (1) construct indicators, called sensors, starting from the geographical neo-classical approach based on physical distance, for measuring and studying the spatial dynamics of technological transfer; (2) apply the metrics to case studies using data from three institutes of the Italian National Council of Research operating in an industrialised region in the north-west Italy.

Design/methodology/approach - This briefing is prepared by an independent writer who adds their own impartial comments and places the articles in context. Findings - At the FT Innovate 2006: Innovation for Growth conference, organized by FT Conferences, a number of presenters and leading thinkers tackled the question, what can you do to make your organization a constant innovator? One presentation looked at the importance of business mindsets, and reported that one of the biggest barriers to innovation is the factor of gravity; a metaphor that relates to the invisible mindset that drags down ideas: it blocks new ideas and minimizes ""orbit-shifting"" initiatives. Another presentation reported the importance that metrics can make when it comes to innovation and creativity; a sensible set of metrics, driven by leadership, can massively change or enable the implementation of an innovation program much more effectively, and more rapidly, than any type of change management initiative. Practical implications - Provides strategic insights and practical thinking that have influenced some of the world's leading organizations.

At the transmitter side, the information is modulated by letting termination impedances vary. At the receiver side, network scattering parameters are measured for different frequencies and used by supervised classification techniques to recover the digital streams of the transmitters. The system is optimized through the joint design of four parts: the transmitter modulation scheme, the cable network characteristics, the measured scattering parameters and the receiver algorithm.

This provides on the one hand synthetic and detailed information on the forces efficiency related to their tactical performances, life cycle cost, human factors and programmatic aspects, and on the other hand recommendations to the analysts for further optimizations of the solution according to the main criteria being studied.","Agile architecture; HLA/SEDRIS; Network Centric Warfare; Simulation Based Acquisition; VV&A process","Agile manufacturing systems; Fuzzy logic; Germanium; Innovation; Interoperability; Mathematical models; Military applications; Network architecture; Aggregation model; Assessment tool; Behavior rules; Distributed architecture; Engineering activities; HLA/SEDRIS; Lifecycle costs; Light Armored Vehicles; Multi-criteria decision making; Network centric warfare; Operational scenario; Procurement agency; Simulation based acquisition; Toolsets; Traditional systems; Weapon system; Computer simulation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84867513473"

The value of measurement is evidenced by the growing trend of industrial best practice models such as PSM and CMMI. However, the resources of specialty knowledge and innovation are not always served by traditional measurement approaches that are often biased to the information needs of management or other stakeholders. Furthermore, where metrics are collected, there is sometimes insufficient evidence to demonstrate that they are adequately informing decision making processes. In this paper we present our initial findings from an investigation into measurement approaches for the integration of technical and managerial decision making. We discuss the problems of managing the development of complex systems and their implications for research and practice. In particular, we introduce a novel measurement approach, called Context-based Measurement (CbM) that exploits controlled natural language to form measurement systems that, with sufficient scope and clarity, may help to bridge the divide between specialists, their terminology and decision-making styles.","Context-based Measurement (CbM); Management of complex systems; Metrics; Software technology management","Computer software; Concurrent engineering; Decision making; Industrial research; Iterative methods; Mathematical models; Real time systems; Context-based measurement; Stakeholders; Industrial management","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-1142299873"

Due to the dynamic topology, several routing algorithms have been proposed to forward data packets between the nodes such as proactive and reactive routing protocols. Quality of Services (QoS) in MANET became a challenge and a focus of several researchers. Several approaches have been suggested to improve QoS especially on Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol. In this paper we propose an adaptive multi-path QoS aware Dynamic Source Routing Protocol. The protocol will collect information about QoS metrics during the route discovery phase and use them to choose a set of disjoint paths, and distributes the data based on QoS they provide. Each node has to monitor links and adoptively adds or removes paths whenever it is needed to achieve the required QoS. The simulation experiments will be conducted using GloMoSim network simulator. We will compare the performance of the suggested algorithm to the performance of the conventional DSR. © 2006 IEEE.","","Access control; Ad hoc networks; Information technology; Innovation; Laws and legislation; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network protocols; Network routing; Quality of service; Routing algorithms; Technology; Telecommunication networks; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Data packets; Disjoint paths; Dynamic Source Routing Protocol; Dynamic Source Routing protocols; Dynamic topologies; GloMoSim; Mobile ad-hoc network; Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks; Mobile nodes; Multi-path; Network Simulator; QoS aware; Qos metrics; Reactive routing protocols; Route discovery; Simulation experiments; Wireless medium; Routing protocols","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-50049130848"

A sustainable development perspective on current patterns of metals use and reuse reveals competing goals. Creating greater intra-generational equity in social and economic opportunity will increase the global stock of metals in use, through primary metals production, which could threaten environmental sustainability. The sustainable development agenda for metal production and use is therefore multifaceted, including dematerialisation, design for disassembly and recycling, optimisation of end-of-life product recovery and recycling systems, and environmental innovations in primary metals production. Upon consideration of this context, opportunities for environmental innovations in primary metals production are focused upon here, for which eco-efficiency (EE) provides the starting point. The paper provides both environmental sustainability and operational perspectives on the application of EE in primary metals production. The environmental sustainability perspective is clarified using a hierarchy of sustainability principles, from the fundamentals of ecological systems to operational practices and metrics for businesses, which justifies a focus on EE at the firm level. Earlier attempts to define EE and related concepts for primary metals production are briefly reviewed, leading to an integrated framework. This connects five 'prevention practices' (process design; input substitution; plant improvement; good housekeeping; reuse and recycling) with five 'resource productivity themes' (resource efficiency; energy use and greenhouse gas emissions; water use and impacts; control of minor elements and toxics; by-product creation). EE methods are then outlined as they apply to continuous improvement of existing operations and in the realisation of major projects. It is concluded that EE is an important milestone on the sustainable development journey for primary metals production. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In all three studies, a major focus has been on identifying system concepts, architectures and technologies that may ultimately produce a practical, economically viable source of electrical power to help satisfy the world's growing energy needs. As part of the SERT program, members of the study team developed several new and innovative SSP concepts that sprung from a desire to address the problem areas of previous system concepts with new technology and system solutions. In the previous SSP studies it has been shown that systems analyses and sensitivity studies are key to understanding the merits of different system concepts and technologies, particularly with respect to their impact on the mass and cost of space hardware and their ultimate economic impact on the cost of SSP-produced electricity. Enabled by analytical models and tools developed over the series of SSP studies, seven different system concepts as well as different technology choices within these concepts were quantitatively compared with one another on the basis of the mass and cost metrics suggested above. Accompanying sensitivity studies have permitted examination of how variations in the projected capabilities of different technologies could affect conclusions drawn from these analyses. This paper summarizes the results of these analytical efforts and from those results, identifies the most promising SSP concepts, including their key technologies and their comparative advantages and disadvantages. © 2003 International Astronautical Federation.

Design/methodology/approach - Senior executives can use the suite of metrics to assess their company's innovativeness over time and hence combat the insidious strategy decay that often afflicts a company's business. Findings - The framework combines three views on innovation - resource, capability, and leadership - providing the perspective to develop a suite of metrics for assessing and developing a company's capacity for innovation. Research limitations/implications - The optimal selection of metrics and the optimal value or ""sweet spot"" of any particular metric will vary from company to company. Practical implications - As more firms develop strategic innovation metrics and a database that validates their relevance, top managers will learn to assess and guide a company's innovation capability more effectively.

One rich source of information is the changing content of discourse of R&D, as the technology progresses. We analyze the content of research paper abstracts obtained by searching large databases on a given topic. We then map the evolution of that topic's emphasis areas. The present research seeks to validate a process that creates factors (clusters) based on term usage in technical papers. Three composite quality measures-cohesion, entropy, and F measure-are computed. Using these measures, we create standard factor groupings that optimize the composite term sets and facilitate comparisons of the R&D emphasis areas (i.e., clusters) over time. The conceptual foundation for this approach lies in the presumption that domain knowledge expands and becomes more application specific in nature as a technology matures. We hypothesize implications for this knowledge expansion in terms of the three factor measures, then observe these empirically for the case of a particular technology-autonomous navigation. These metrics can provide indicators of technological maturation. © 2002 Published by Science Inc.","Innovation indicators; R&D cluster quality measures; Technology maturity","Database systems; Information analysis; Knowledge engineering; Quality control; Research and development management; Quality measures; innovation; measurement method; quality control; research and development; Technological forecasting","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0041421198"

However, due to a lack of tools available for configuring and analyzing data, human resource professionals are often unable to keep themselves abreast of changes in their workforce, make complex decisions using job data, and facilitate communication across jobs, job families or departments in their organization. As a result, advanced methods for analysis of job data are needed. Metrics are quantitative algorithms applied to job data that aid in decision making in areas such as recruitment, selection, transferability, promotion, training, and development. Metrics are a sophisticated, user-friendly approach to analyzing job data that have the potential to meet the needs of human resource professionals in today's dynamic workplace. The development of metrics, their application and benefit to human resource professionals, and their use of O*NET are discussed. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

S. workforce and 69 percent of graduates from an example technological university. Yet, university research and education have not followed suit. Clearly, services research and education deserve our critical attention and support since services - and services innovation - serve as an indispensable engine for global economic growth. The theme of this paper is that we can and should build services research and education on what has occurred in manufacturing research (especially in regard to customization and intellectual property) and education; indeed, services and manufactured goods become indistinguishable as they are jointly co-produced in real-time. Fortunately, inasmuch as manufacturing concepts, methodologies and technologies have been developed and refined over a long period of time (i.e., since the 1800s), the complementary set of concepts, methodologies and technologies for services are more obvious. However, while new technologies (e.g., the Internet) and globalization trends have served to enable, if not facilitate, services innovation, the same technologies (e.g., the Internet) and 21st Century realities (e.g., terrorism) are making services innovation a far more complex problem and, in fact, may be undermining previous innovations in both services and manufacturing. Finally, there is a need to define a ""knowledge- adjusted"" GDP metric that can more adequately measure the growing knowledge economy, one driven by intangible ideas and services innovation. © Systems Engineering Society of China and Springer 2006.","Customization; Education; Innovation; Intellectual property; Manufacturing; Services","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-33749238876"

This method entails analyzing the management of a variety of construction projects by the student teams according to 13 different criteria and making presentations of their analysis and an overall summary statement. The presentations are evaluated by judges from the industry using the special metrics created for this purpose. Student performance is also incorporated as a metric in the assessment process.

Design/methodology/approach - Investigates the global versus local domain name selection strategies and web site popularity of multinational corporations based on their organizational characteristics and Hofstede's cultural values of their host countries. Findings - Organizational size, industry and two cultural values - individualism and masculinity - relate to how companies adopt innovations, in this case selecting and promoting a global or local online identity. For their web presence, most Fortune Global 500 companies use the global.com domain rather than a local country domain. The results also suggest a virtual divide in online visibility, favoring.com companies over companies using country domains. Research limitations/implications - Limitations of this study include the lack of a longitudinal perspective and a possible Google bias - towards English content - in its proprietary PageRank metric. Future research could validate the results with other third-party data and enrich the independent variables through automated web content analysis. Practical implications - In countries with strong cultural values of masculinity and collectivism, international business managers should consider paying homage to local domain names for web site and employee email addresses.

This state of affairs, among other causes, has brought about a strong tendency towards the analysis of different specialized information sources, with the intention of setting a course towards even more radical and successful innovations. Among these information sources, patent documents stand out as main protagonists. The analysis with metric techniques of the information contained in the patents has become one of the main tools for the modeling of the technological scenarios of countries, enterprises, research institutes, subject matters, projects, etcetera. Based on the use of a series of metric indicators, it is possible to identify patterns and tendencies, with the available technological evidence, as well as to detect possible unidentified innovation social webs with a different investigative behavior, which is useful for, among other functions, the making of opportune decisions if the investigation so requires. To illustrate this project was used a practical case: the project: Chemical Composition of the Wood, Bark and Foliage of Three Species of Eucalyptus in the Province of Pinar del Río. The records of patents from the United States database were used as information source, and processed with a tool of our own, developed by the University of Pinar del Río and Ucinet, a software to represent the possibly existing webs.

Besides yielding data on the important subject of the NPD going on in the country's manufacturing companies, the overall project was also an exercise on the use and effectiveness of those types of surveys. It is argued that such NPD data actually constitute predictive metrics for the region's future manufacturing business sustainability.

This is one reason why quality has become essential for ensuring that a company's products and processes meet customers' needs. A recent innovation in the systems area is the development of a set of mechanisms and models for evaluating quality. This article describes the design of a Quality Model with a systemic approach to software products that assesses a product's efficiency and effectiveness. Different quality models were studied: McCall, Boehm, FURPS, ISO 9126, Dromey, ISO 15504 in an attempt to identify the aspects present in these models that are deemed important in a Systemic Quality model. We designed a model prototype that reflects the essential attributes of quality. This model was evaluated using a method so it can be validated and also enhanced. The evaluation method consisted of: designing a survey, formulating, validating and applying the measurement instruments; defining an algorithm to obtain the quality estimate and analyzing the results. The model prototype enabled the strengths and weaknesses of the software products studied to be identified. When evaluating a software product using the model prototype, it was possible to ascertain its compliance with the standards and use the results to improve it. Since the evaluation was systemic, processes that affect certain characteristics of the product could be identified. Companies can benefit from the model proposed because it serves as a benchmark that allows their products to evolve and be competitive.","Dromey's model; ISO 9126; Metrics; Quality model; Software product quality; Systemic quality","Algorithms; Benchmarking; Information retrieval systems; Mathematical models; Matrix algebra; Product design; Program processors; Quality control; Software prototyping; Dromey's model; ISO 9126; Quality model; Software product quality; Systemic quality; Computer software","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-3543054780"

More specifically, there are four customer drivers (i.e., collaboration, customization, integration and adaptation), three business foci (i.e., creation-focused, solution-focused and competition-focused) , six business principles (i.e., reconstruct market boundaries, focus on the big picture not numbers, reach beyond existing demand, get strategic sequence right, overcome organizational hurdles and build execution into strategy), eight technical enablers (i.e., software algorithms, automation, telecommunication, collaboration, standardization, customization, organization, and globalization), and six attributes of decision informatics (i.e., decision-driven, information-based, real-time, continuously-adaptive, customer-centric and computationally-intensive). It should be noted that the four customer drivers are all directed at empowering the individual - that is, at recognizing that the individual can, respectively, contribute in a collaborative situation, receive customized or personalized attention, access an integrated system or process, and obtain adaptive real-time or just-in-time input. The developed process or calculus serves to identify the potential white spaces or blue oceans for innovation. In addition to expanding on current innovations in services and related experiences, white spaces are identified for possible future innovations; they include those that can mitigate the unforeseen consequences or abuses of earlier innovations, safeguard our rights to privacy, protect us from the always-on, interconnected world, provide us with an authoritative search engine, and generate a GDP metric that can adequately measure the growing knowledge economy, one driven by intangible ideas and services innovation. © Systems Engineering Society of China and Springer 2007.","Adaptation; Automation; Business principles; Collaboration; Customization; Decision informatics; Globalization; Innovation; Integration; Organization; Services; Software algorithms; Standardization; Telecommunication","Automation; Computer software; Decision making; International cooperation; Societies and institutions; Standardization; Strategic planning; Telecommunication services; Business principles; Collaboration; Decision informatics; Globalization; Software algorithms; Multimedia services","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-34347214135"

Second, it explores the potential of regional innovation strategies in the context of less favoured regions and argues that they have an important role to play in regional renewal even though their impact to date has been modest. Finally, it suggests that the most limiting aspect of the 'new regionalism' debate is that virtually all contributions tend to confine themselves to an inordinately narrow metric of development and, wittingly or not, this tends to conflate what is instrumentally significant with what is intrinsically significant, a conflation of means and ends. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.","","European Union; governance approach; innovation; regional development; regionalism","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-5444250317"

It is imperative that the NGN service providers consider and use Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and its principles to achieve business goals and optimize longterm capital investment without compromising customer experience. We have studied the current problems faced by NGN Service Providers, and arrived at an innovative solution based on mathematical model to assist the Next Generation Network (NGN) service providers to use quantitative metrics to reach higher levels of service orientation. In addition, this methodology can be used to measure and optimize every investment made towards SOA alignment. Also, this methodology can be used to perform ""what-if"" analysis, in order to assess the impact of the business decisions without actually implementing those decisions. © 2006 IEEE.","","Decision making; Innovation; Mathematical models; Optimization; Problem solving; Quality of service; Telecommunication services; Next Generation Networks; Perennial problem; Quantitative metrics; Service Oriented Architecture; Telecommunication networks","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-35148813209"

Performance results achieved on a number of NPD metrics are reported first, followed by a set of Best Performing businesses, what these businesses have in common and - most important - what differentiates them from the rest. This first article focuses on the ""people side"" of NPD - on how project teams are organized and on other winning characteristics of teams. The climate and culture for innovation within the business proves to be one of the strongest drivers of NPD performance, and the specifics of what the Best Performers have done to achieve this positive climate are outlined. Finally the role of senior management in setting the stage for the business's NPD effort is examined.","","Benchmarking; Industry; Performance; Product development; Strategic planning; Innovation; New product development practices; Senior management; Industrial research","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0346503004"

This article argues that private firms can not only learn from public organizations and performance measurement, they can also profit from it. The article proceeds from the Innovations System literature and applies it to the Canadian steel industry and examines public policies directed at improving the innovation performance of private firms. The most commercially successful firms are those that effectively interact with public infrastructure and social capital. Public policies should be critically examined in the same light. The analysis finds that the Innovation Strategy policy being implemented by Industry Canada, including its Innovation Targets, are misdirected and are likely to miss the most promising sources of innovation in the steel industry. © 2004 IIAS, SAGE Publications (London, Thousand Oaks, CA and New Delhi).","","Canada; North America; industrial performance; innovation; iron and steel industry; performance assessment","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-1942505835"

Social roles and the position of actors become more complex with increasing embeddedness in a growing number of relations -for instance through affiliations to multiple and changing work teams. Two research disciplines investigate such heterogeneous social networks: research on social networks and research on product innovation. Both offer different explanations for the types of interaction that are best suited for knowledge creation and sharing. This paper integrates both types of research whilst focusing on innovation effectiveness. In analogy to telecommunication, where multiplexity denotes the ability to transport a multitude of signals through a single line or cable, we refer to social multiplexity as a concurrent and productive affiliation to a multitude of social network functions. We show that in particular job-external and emotional contacts of employees may strengthen competitive advantages of firms. As a conclusion, previous recommendations of literature are suspected to increase rather than decrease risks.","Balancing work & family; Communication; Creativity; Group dynamics; Metrics","Hierarchical systems; Knowledge engineering; Risk assessment; Social aspects; Societies and institutions; Cellular network organizations; Creativity; Group dynamics; Social network theory; Research and development management","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-1142299841"
