BoW directly enables heterogeneous integration, a primary advantage of chiplets. We discuss progress on BoW based on extensive design and performance studies by engineers from multiple companies. These studies aim to make BoW easy to use in a system.

The large diversity of cases, firms, sectors and open activities, and the multiple factors affecting success has made it difficult to elaborate a general framework where to extract from some policy design rules adapted to specific contexts; thus, involved firms do not have a consolidated framework to measure the effectiveness of the open innovation practices in use. Open innovation for RD activities conducted by multinational firms is usually carried out at the international level looking for specific knowledge and complementarity of partners. One of the critical factors for success in open innovation activities is the 'right selection of adequate partners'. This paper postulates that the multi-variable selection based on the previous characterization of the relationship between the firm and one potential international partner constitutes a key factor for success. In addition, the article presents a semi-quantitative approach to measure the 'differences' (a metrics based on 'proximity' is defined) to analyze and compare between different partners from several dimensions. The key goal is to select external partners with the 'minimum distance' to the firm.

The quantity of contributions and the resource demands to identify valuable ideas is high and remains challenging for firms that apply open innovation initiatives. To solve these problems, research on algorithmic approaches proved to be a valuable way by identifying metrics to distinguish between high and low-quality ideas. However, such filtering approaches always risk missing promising ideas by classifying good ideas as bad ones. In response, organizations have turned to the crowd to not just for generating ideas but also to evaluate them to filter high quality contributions. However, such crowd-based filtering approaches tend to perform poorly in practice as they make unrealistic demands on the crowd. We, therefore, conduct a design science research project to provide prescriptive knowledge on how to combine machine learning techniques with crowd evaluation to adaptively assign humans to ideas. © 2018 Leuphana Universitat Luneburg.

Co-creation has been linked with many tools and platforms, without a coherent framework and specific guiding principles to follow, especially within the smart cities’ context for developing new services. For this reason, it is required to clearly define which are the methods and digital tools that cities should pursue to fully exploit the potential of these platforms in terms of enhancing global collaborations. Starting from the review of the literature on participatory design, co-creation and open innovation, the paper aims to discuss the role of Living Labs in supporting service design for smart cities, by providing an effective approach for involving stakeholders in real life experimentation through digital platforms. The evaluation has taken into account the current use of co-creation approaches by eight smart cities involved in the SynchroniCity project, and considered as the current best practices in Europe. The analysis focused on timing, stakeholders, activities for involving citizens, rewarding systems, tools and metrics used to investigate the success of their implementation. Ten methods and twelve tools have been selected as the one best supporting smart cities in service design and their real application has been investigated through an online questionnaire and in depth interviews to the cities. As a result of the study, Living Lab has resulted as the most used and effective method for the smart cities in the EU for service design. © 2019, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Co-creation; Internet of things; Living labs; Participatory design; Service design; Smart cities","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049369176"

It assumes that internal ideas can also be taken to market through external channels, outside a firm's current businesses, to generate additional value. To manage innovation within such system and to monitor the opportunities offered by that system, companies need to alter their usual metrics for managing innovation.","","Customer satisfaction; Marketing; Research and development management; Societies and institutions; Technology; Closed innovation; Market uncertainty; Open innovation; Technical uncertainty; Industrial management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-3142742437"

However, innovation is hard to define and, therefore, even harder to measure. To help policy makers and business leaders better understand how to foster innovation, we need robust ways to quantify innovation at local and global scales. In this work, we use a data-driven, machine-learning approach for measuring innovation. Analyzing a large number of country-level metrics, we aim to automatically discover actionable 'levers' of innovation. Using unsupervised learning methods, we determine groups of related world development indicators among a collection compiled by the World Bank. We then train a Group Lasso predictive model using data from the World Economic Forum (WEF) that captures the perceived level of innovation in 150 countries. Aside from providing high predictive accuracy, the Group Lasso also provides a model that is easily interpretable. The result is the Open Innovation Index (OII), an automatic global model for measuring innovation using machine learning algorithms and open data. We predict the OII scores for countries that only have World Development Indicators data and no existing WEF innovation scores. Furthermore, we also present case studies for which the innovation levers of a few representative countries are uncovered automatically by the proposed model. © 1957-2012 IBM.","","Artificial intelligence; Economics; Learning systems; Unsupervised learning; Business leaders; Data-driven approach; Economic competitiveness; Level of innovation; Machine learning approaches; Predictive accuracy; Predictive modeling; Unsupervised learning method; Learning algorithms","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038613859"

However, in the digitally connected world the organisation is increasingly challenged to protect personal data and there is greater potential for inappropriate data use or disclosure, which can result in legal, financial, and reputational consequences for the organisation. Developments brought about by digital transformation increase the requirement for more stringent approaches to personal data protection to be implemented by the organisation. In most countries, data protection is taken very seriously and enforced through strict regulations (e.g. GDPR) which every organisation who holds personal data must adhere to. However, high-profile data breaches continue to occur. Research suggests that data protection controls have not kept pace with the degree to which organisations are experimenting with digital technologies and the unprecedented data volumes. Many organisations are unable to detect when or where their data systems have been breached. In order to comply with regulatory requirements to protect personal data and avoid potentially significant legal, financial, and reputational implications of a data breach, many organisations must improve their personal data protection approaches. This paper presents the key components or ‘capability building blocks’ of a conceptual framework in the area of Personal Data Protection (PDP) within the organisational context. This framework was developed based on the findings or themes that emerged from a systematic literature review (SLR) in this area followed by an open innovation approach. The resultant conceptual framework can be used by organisations to undertake a holistic analysis of their personal data protection capability. The framework also includes a set of POMs (Practices, Outcomes and Metrics) which acts as a roadmap for organisations to improve upon their current level of maturity in this area to effectively protect personal data and to demonstrate that the organisation is a trustworthy data custodian. © 2019, Curran Associates Inc.

However, practitioners often find that evaluating the quality of TI activities can be very challenging. Whilst several papers in current literature discuss performance assessments in innovation contexts, less research specifically addresses the issue of performance measurement for TI. This paper aims to start to fill this gap by developing empirical evidence about the current evaluation methods adopted in industry, and the challenges posed by the metrics used in assessing TI. A framework is proposed, which suggests that the metrics used for TI follow two logics: The first is that they are activity- or outcome-based, and the second is that they apply either to specific projects or to the entire firm. This classification of metrics could help practitioners structure their future measuring and evaluating strategies. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","assessment; decision-making; effectiveness; efficiency; evaluation; information quality; innovation management measurement; metrics; open innovation; performance measure; technology intelligence; technology scouting","Efficiency; Quality control; assessment; effectiveness; evaluation; Information quality; Innovation management; metrics; Open innovation; Performance measure; Technology intelligence; Technology scouting; Decision making","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026755318"

Open innovation adoption is evaluated through an accounting approach by examining all the costs, revenues, new investments and divestments of intangibles related to open transactions. The work relies on empirical data on a sample of 102 R&D intense bio-pharmaceutical companies. Results show that patent applications, body of knowledge and technological differentiation are positively correlated each other. Further, they exhibit a positive correlation with firm size, age and financial performances and a negative one with open innovation adoption, in particular as to operational outbound practices.

The present study investigates the essential intra- and extra-organizational factors in determining the performance of firms using the European Company Survey (ECS) 2019 framework. The evolutionary computation method of genetic algorithm and the machine learning method of Bayesian additive regression trees (BART), are used to model the importance of each of the intra- and extra-organizational factors in identifying the firms’ performance as well as employee well-being. The standard metrics are further used to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method. The mean value of the evaluation metrics for the accuracy of the impact of intra- and extra-organizational factors on firm performance are MAE = 0.225, MSE = 0.065, RMSE = 0.2525, and R2 = 0.9125, and the value of these metrics for the accuracy of the impact of intra- and extra-organizational factors on employee well-being are MAE = 0.18, MSE = 0.0525, RMSE = 0.2275, and R2 = 0.88. The low values of MAE, MSE and RMSE, and the high value of R2, indicate the high level of accuracy of the proposed method. The results revealed that the two variables of work organization and innovation are essential in improving firm performance well-being, and that the variables of collaboration and outsourcing, as well as job complexity and autonomy, have the greatest role in improving firm performance. © 2022 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; Bayesian additive regression trees; big data; deep learning; firm performance; machine learning; management; open innovation; organizational performance; social science","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144694318"

In this research, we contend that existing models of diffusion are not adequate to capture the multi-faceted nature of generative diffusion. To address this challenge, we use concepts from biological sciences to propose a multi-dimensional perspective to study generative diffusion, and construct three metrics: proliferation, evolvability, and temporality. Further, we use techniques inspired by genetics to measure these constructs in the context of open source software. In this research in progress manuscript, we demonstrate the applicability of our work with one example of an open source software project. This study makes an immense contribution not only to the study of open innovation, but also makes a methodological contribution by introducing the use of evolutionary genetics to study digital artifacts.","Diffusion of innovation; Generativity; Open source software development; Phylogenetic analysis","Computer software; Ecosystems; Information systems; Diffusion of innovations; Evolutionary genetics; Generativity; Methodological contributions; Open Source Software; Open source software development; Open source software projects; Phylogenetic analysis; Chromosomes","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84886562871"

In addition, the objective of our empirical survey is to define the capacities and skills essential to the success of a digital transformation. The study focused on: (1) establishing the extent to which digital marketing has been adopted by firms in Tunisia and (2) determining the influence of digital transformation on the open innovation performance of Tunisian firms. The result of the integration of techno-log ical power into the management of enterprises gives rise to a digitalisation that disrupts marketing strategies, significantly contributing to the creation of new business models. The results revealed that the use of digital marketing is significantly linked to three open innovation performance metrics: increased revenue, acquisition of new customers and retention of existing customers. This open innovation performance also has a positive and significant relationship with the use of digital channels by customers, showing that cus-tom ers using digital channels in their purchasing process will tend to buy, consume and be more loyal than customers using the classic channels. © Henry Stewart Publications 2054-7544 (2022).","digital marketing; digital transformation; open innovation performance; partial least square (PLS) approach","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143596315"

A number of approaches have been taken, including microeconomic analyses of specific technologies and macroeconomic modelling of long-term productivity gains. Most of these approaches have estimated very positive returns to investments in space. The problem is that these approaches have generally been carried out in an economic context, which no longer characterizes today's open economy, this calling for new ways to measure the tangible benefits in return for the considerable sums invested. The way to conceive technological transfer, R&D policies, collaborative modes, and evaluation procedures have changed in an open context. Such a context offers an opportunity to revisit and update the main methods and tools used to measure the economic, societal and environmental benefits from space (in particular with regards to industry-government-university partnerships, user communities, collaboration within and between these communities, and so on). The wide variety of assumptions behind existing models often limit the range of results. Moreover, many controversies remain as to the interpretation of these results. In this paper, we present the preliminary results of a three-year study, carried out on behalf of the Canadian Space Agency, on the state of the Canadian space sector. We focus on the limitations of the methodologies used to assess the indirect economic and societal impacts of public investment in space in an open innovation context. We present a new perspective on innovation in space in which innovation is not so much driven by spin-offs from the space industry, as it is by spin-ins from various terrestrial industries. This finding impacts strongly the way we measure indirect economic impacts and calls for new metrics. These new metrics should be helpful for governments and national space agencies to support long-term planification of public investments in the space sector, in order to protect and develop a national competitive advantage in niche markets with an emphasis in commercialization of space technologies on Earth and space applications.","","Competition; Economic and social effects; Economics; Industrial economics; Investments; Productivity; Space applications; Canadian Space Agency; Environmental benefits; Industry government; Microeconomic analysis; National competitive advantages; Research and development; Technological transfer; University partnership; Earth (planet)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84938117643"

Results show a negative correlation of openness with firm age, dimension and efficiency and a positive correlation with R&D intensity, with biotech companies being more open than pharmaceutical ones. Further, the most relevant component of openness is represented by the revenues deriving from joint development projects, out-licensing and R&D outsourcing.

However, investments in customer relationships carry the potential risk to destroy value and reduce profitability when based on incorrect estimates of customer profitability. Therefore, estimating future customer value correctly is essential to allocate marketing expenditures in the most effective way. In this article recent literature about the CLV is reviewed in order to assess its ability as a customer profitability measure. Besides the financial perspective of the CLV, non-financial perspectives such as customer advocacy, (customer or open) innovation and learning have been identified to have an impact on customer profitability. How to properly estimate a customer's value taking all relevant value creating factors, financial as well as non-financial, into account is the underlying research question. Design/methodology/approach: This research is based on the review of a number of theoretical and empirical articles published between 1990 and 2010. The aggregation of measures, key-drivers and risks of each key-perspective of the customer relationship contributes to the development of a more systematic understanding of the value creation process and provides answers to the research question. Indirect effects of the CLV as a source of value have received increasing attention in previous research but are not sufficiently accounted for by mainstream methods for valuing customers (Ryals, 2008). Therefore, the attempt to structure available knowledge on indirect effects of the CLV in its contextual setting is made. Findings: This research is concluded providing evidence that one-dimensional calculations of the CLV deliver an incomplete picture of the customer relationship and estimate customer profitability incorrectly. This supports the idea of a multidimensional CLV approach that accounts for interrelated key-perspectives and results in superior resource allocation. Originality/value: Seeing customers in a comprehensive way helps to better understand their needs and potential contributions, so that long-term overall profitability can be advanced through the consideration of indirect effects. Indirect effects are usually not reflected in common accounting methods but might result in benefits for the firm. In this research, evidence is provided for the importance of indirect effects offered by customers. This makes the consideration of all relevant dimensions in the value creation process fundamental in order to allocate marketing resources in the most effective way.","Customer lifetime value; Customer profitability; Customer relationship management; Non-financial values","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84856295393"

Incorporation of open innovation into the product development process allows for a vast array of unique perspectives and ideas. However, with the broad expansion of design possibilities, coordination of these development processes is paramount. To best make use of open innovation in product development, increased organizational efforts must be considered. The mass collaboration of individuals must account for individual intellectual abilities (competencies), working experience and even personality traits or idiosyncrasies. Approaches to this problem require the fusion of social network analysis with quantifiable design impacts. This work proposes a simulation framework that evaluates the design potential of a project team based on individual attributes and the team network structure. The overall contribution of this work comes from the exploration of team structure, focusing on network composition metrics such as centrality and network density, while attempting to understand the role of individual ability and positioning on the success of the design process. This work aims to garner a more thorough understanding of how the network structure of design teams correlates with their potential performance through a generalized simulation framework, applicable to future crowd and design initiatives. © The Author(s) 2018 Distributed as Open Access under a CC-BY 4.0 license.","Collaborative design; Design projects; Mass collaboration","Product development; Collaboration design; Collaboration efforts; Collaborative design; Design projects; Mass collaboration; Network characteristics; Product development process; Simulation framework; Design","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056816910"

Design/methodology/approach: The theoretical framework is built after a thorough review of OI literature. The managerial tool is developed from the theoretical framework, constructing indicators that can be easily generated by processing data within information systems of companies. Findings: The scorecard provides a multi-dimensional conceptualisation of OI adoption in organisations, investigating environment, collaboration and importing/exporting mechanisms. Six indicators are defined: innovation funds, OI employees, collaboration costs, collaboration revenues, importing costs and exporting revenues. Research limitations/implications: The devised tool enables the assessment of openness through objective and available data, systematically updated within the information systems of companies and, hence, easily exploitable by innovation managers. In order to meet such conditions, several aspects emerged from the literature review, although relevant, were left out. Practical implications: Three dashboards can be derived by exploiting the information available in the scorecard. With the use of such tools innovation managers can both assess the open behaviours of their companies – identifying the trajectories to follow in order to improve performance – and benchmark different OI practices either inside or outside the organisation. Originality/value: The scorecard allows innovation managers both to carry out a cost-benefit analysis, evaluating if their organisations are effectively and efficiently generating outputs from OI with the committed resources, and to identify a virtuous circle between the company’s commitment and reputation, joint development, and innovation market opportunities. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cost-benefit analysis; Innovation metrics; Managerial tool; Open innovation; Open innovation models; Scorecard","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032474885"

The evaluation of the firm’s performance in SPs results in determinant to identify the needs of the companies and the feasibility of the University-Business Collaboration (UBC). Firm’s real needs also are of interest of Universities, since they face the challenge of designing strategies that best help them to transfer the knowledge more effectively.

BoW bandwidth can range from 80 Gbps per 16-bit BoW slice with a simple design to 512 Gbps with complex design and packaging. With this flexibility, BoW directly enables heterogeneous integration, a primary advantage of chiplets. In turn, this will enable economies of scale for services and technologies for BoW. In this paper, we discuss progress on the BoW specification based on extensive design and performance studies by engineers from multiple companies. These studies aim to specify BoW so as to make it easy to use in a system.

While the world has moved on from Bell Labs' famous advanced research model, visionary and farsighted technology-driven innovation is still vital to many of today's most successful global technology companies. Corporate innovation strategies are implemented through research laboratories, academic collaborations, advanced technology groups, standards groups, CTO office prototypes, internal/ external incubations, and open innovations. Unlike the well-understood nature of short-term product development, long time frames, fuzzily defined goals, and unclear measures of success lead to uncertainty of how to best run and fund advanced technology and applied corporate research. While all firms agree that advanced research is vital, their measures and processes differ widely. To identify modern models of effective advanced research approaches, the context in which such approaches are most effective, and the metrics by which they should be evaluated, we interviewed leaders at various successful and established global firms such as Cisco, Intel, Google, and others. We used the data collected to inductively arrive at six models that characterize modern advanced research approaches. The approaches of these models were different in the sense that some rely on academic and industry collaboration while others revolve around disrupting the status quo. The fact that the companies included in this study were successful means that all the models reflect a useful approach to advanced research. Therefore, no single model should be considered as better or ideal than the other. The models could be of use to a company trying to create an appropriate advanced research approach based on its goals and needs. Similarly, these models could help a company fine tune its existing RandD approach as its goals and identity develop over time. The models we present here provide useful terminology and will serve as backbone for further study of advanced development & corporate research approaches. © 2015 IEEE.","advanced development; corporate research; product and service development","Industrial management; Innovation; Research laboratories; advanced development; Advanced researches; Advanced technology; Advanced technology groups; Corporate innovation; Corporate research; Industry collaboration; Product and service development; Engineering research","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84968718783"

Large-scale research and commercial applications of these computations are developing rapidly across artificial intelligence fields as diverse as semantic text querying, retrieval of multimedia materials, and prediction of the properties of pharmacological molecules and engineered materials. While vector similarity searching is, at present, predominantly implemented on standard central processing unit (CPU) hardware running optimized indexing algorithms, the interest in massively-parallel computing architectures is increasing. Accordingly, a range of systems based on graphics processing units (GPU) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) have been proposed; however, the availability of the design materials for these systems remains largely confined to a small number of corporations and research institutions. Here, we introduce a fully open-source hardware accelerator for vector similarity searching, based on an array of 21 FPGAs densely intertwined with 42 GB of high-speed dynamic memory and installed on a custom-designed compute node board, which yields an aggregate bandwidth of 33.6 GB/s and can be seamlessly reconfigured to implement nearly arbitrary distance calculations. A novel logic and software architecture, based on a lane-wise organization of independent engines implementing distributed distance calculation and sorting, allows attaining noteworthy query latency and power consumption performance on both single- and multi-node system configurations.

It is well known that for many small business entrepreneurs and managers, the idea of OI practices are still restricted to large corporations. Against this idea, this work proposes an understanding of these OI practices, besides an analysis of its measurement. The indicators proposed by this work has been proved to be the most significant to measure OI at this kind of company and, with them, it has been possible to understand that small companies can successfully use OI and, although it is not common today, it should be encouraged.

OI is relevant for small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) because it allows them to adapt and thrive in increasingly turbulent and dynamic competitive environments, generate competitive advantages, and increase their performances. The method adopted for measuring OI is heterogeneous because of the breadth of the concept and application of various OI metrics and practices. This study analyzes the various methods used for measuring OI in the SME context through a systematic review of the empirical literature. To meet this objective, a two-step methodological approach was implemented: first, a systematic literature review, and second, a bibliometric analysis. Finally, 125 empirical articles from 2009 to 2020 were selected from the Web of Science and Scopus databases. The results show that the empirical literature uses a wide variety of methods to measure OI activities. While this adds to the richness of the concept, it makes theory development difficult. Based on the systematic literature review conducted, it is clear that there are different perspectives pertaining to the measurement of OI: (1) external knowledge sources, internal knowledge, and collaboration; (2) technology exploitation and technology exploration; (3) inbound, outbound, and couple; and (4) openness. This study has important implications to researchers and SME managers, will help them develop a better understanding of how OI activities can be measured. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bibliometrics; Empirical studies; Measures; Open innovation; SME","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125936880"

Such partnerships are typically governed by contractual or equity arrangements with clear mutual obligations. More recently, however, organizations have begun to seek strategic partnerships with open innovation communities, which are novel digitally enabled forms of organizing, and where contractual commitments are not possible. Thus, selecting the right open innovation community as an alliance partner becomes a more complex decision. We follow how the organizational decision makers, in two technology firms that were pioneers of forming strategic alliances with open innovation communities, developed metrics around making such decisions. We build upon Shah and Swaminathan's (2008) contingency model of alliance partner selection and consider how it applies to the case of partnering with open innovation communities. This framework was useful in to frame our findings, yet our work recognizes and builds upon two key differences: 1) the evaluation metrics used in selecting an open innovation community were more focused on value creation than value capture; and 2) open ecosystem considerations, and not just partner-specific metrics, featured prominently in this type of alliance partner evaluation. We develop the notions of community and ecosystem health to refer to these new metrics. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Company engagement with open source; Company-community relationship; Open ecosystem; Open innovation; Open source community; Partner selection; Strategic alliances","Decision making; Technology transfer; Open innovation; Open source communities; Open sources; Partner selection; Strategic alliance; Ecosystems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063741188"

The programs are components of a broader agency leadership initiative focused on policies that promote a culture of open innovation and entrepreneurship aimed at improving workforce problem-solving capabilities and mission results. Data were collected and analyzed over a five-year period of employee experience in the two programs. The evaluations included surveys and structured interviews conducted among the participants of both programs. Longitudinally, the curation of data about the value of these programs to employees in their self-assessed ability to pursue and achieve institutional objectives supported iterative adjustments in program operations. Results were also benchmarked against data from the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, an annual organizational survey designed to elucidate attitudes among federal employees across a variety of topics, including innovation and empowerment. This report provides insights into the qualitative and quantitative parameters capable of being leveraged to maximize the design, measurement, and impact of innovationrelated programs and activities. The methods and data described herein represent a medium through which employee-based organizational perceptions about culture can be interrogated and examined.

It is to build a wide path from research and development to commercialization by involving the right people, processes and metrics. In Googol's experience, a vast majority of companies face the largest challenges in the gap between development and commercialization. By thoroughly understanding the innovation route - Research-Development- Commercialization-Market Entry (RDCM) - and by effectively addressing the Development-Commercialization gap, the holy grail of innovation is within reach. The difference in ""Share of Commercialized Patents"" (SCP) varies between organizations and nations. The discrepancy between two nations has been shown to be as far as 75% versus 12%, which is partly a result of patent strategies, but also of the methodology or even lack of structured Innovation Systems. The higher the level of entrepreneurial activities and the earlier the involvement from commercial specialists, the higher the outcome of R&D to repetitively commercialized products and services. Googol's experience from working with a large number of global blue-chip companies has shown that the route from research to commercial breakthrough faces thresholds that can be anticipated and proactively managed - thus controlling risk and enhancing returns to a higher extent. The condensed explanation of how Technology Transfer Systems can be successfully shaped is to build and develop the Innovation Value Chain™ (ICV). The ICV encompasses challenges and solutions that range from organization to product &services, to social structures. Focusing on the Opportunity Epicentre, we suggest adding resources in terms of optimized financial support*, competencies and management focus, and also actively working with methodologies such as Open Innovation, Metrics, and Internal Corporate Venturing. A properly implemented Innovation Value Chain™ assists in developing ideas from a stand-alone position with a fixed commercial value of 100 points to a market-ready solution with an earned commercial and strategic value of 18.600 points. We refer to this as the ""Holy Grail of Innovation"" - when the Opportunity Epicentre has been widened to allow products and solutions to successfully journey from Research to Market.","","Commerce; Innovation; Occupational risks; Research; Technology transfer; Chip companies; Corporate venturing; Entrepreneurial activity; Epicentre; Financial support; Innovation system; Market entry; On currents; Open innovation; Patent strategy; Products and services; Research and development; Social structure; Stand -alone; Strategic values; Transfer systems; Value chains; Patents and inventions","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78049370410"

We provide a measurement of the dual innovation capability (DIC) of NISs based on process-oriented concepts by using a multi-indicator approach, which provides a more comprehensive picture of sectoral NISs compared to currently used metrics. To assess the DIC of NISs, a composite weighting method was used to obtain the score of our selection of 65 countries. The results show the spatio-temporal evolution of DIC from 2010 to 2018 and explore the interactions among sub-elements within the framework. The 65 countries were grouped into 4 categories based on the sub-dimension scores, and we provided 3 possible paths that can be chosen to improve DIC.

Measurement errors (false positives, false negatives) are likely to arise from judgments about the commercial potential of early-stage projects. Most companies' policies consciously limit ""false positives"" in assessing a project's commercial potential, but few companies take steps to manage the risk of ""false negatives.""

This was the third of three surveys conducted by the researchers since 2011. Ten key insights were formulated to gauge the progress of innovation in organizations as well as the practice and success of nine innovation methods (data analytics, design thinking, innovation metrics, etc.) used to support innovation execution. Design/methodology/approach: The survey data was bifurcated into two groups, high and low innovators, by analyzing their innovation scores using a K-means cluster analysis. This was followed by correlational analysis with the innovation practices by these groups. Qualitative survey data was also collected and used to interpret the results. Findings: Overall innovation scores have improved over the decade. Organizations are still struggling with process drivers such as idea management and innovation measures. High innovators are pervasively using innovative methods to advance innovation execution much more than low innovators. The two methods that showed the highest correlation to an innovative culture were design thinking and open innovation. Originality/value: Comparing the Global Innovation Survey to two other surveys, 2011 Canadian Executives (n = 605) and 2013 US Fortune 1000 (n = 1,203) that use the same innovation measurement scale, provides a unique longitudinal perspective. The nine innovation methods investigated in the Global Innovation Survey provide original insight into how high and low innovative organizations are using methods to advance innovation execution. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Culture; Innovation; Innovation score; Measurement; Methods; Survey","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079146190"

Despite the relevance of the issue, few contributions deepen such a relationship after both a conceptual and a quantitative perspective. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to suggest a measure of sustainability for innovation processes and to define which innovation strategies can lead to more sustainable processes. The role of ambidexterity within the corporate sustainability framework is underlined: Ambidextrous organizations are able to improve the innovation performance and better use their resources, improving the sustainability of research and development (R & D) processes. By employing patent data and testing the framework on a sample of worldwide top R & D spending companies in the IT hardware industry, this work suggests which optimal value of ambidexterity will lead to more sustainable innovation. In addition, R & D processes with non-optimal levels of ambidexterity can be managed in a better way. Indeed, results show the usefulness of open innovation adoption to improve the performance of exploration processes. Moreover, R & D activities based on a preponderance of exploitation strategies are more sustainable if they fall into technological domains in which the focal company is highly specialized. The work also contributes to the conceptualization of sustainability and to definition of patent-based metrics related to sustainability. © 2019 by the authors.","Ambidexterity; Exploitation vs. exploration; Innovation; Innovation performance; Open innovation; Patent data; Specialization; Sustainability; Technological strategies","exploitation; exploration; hardware; information technology; innovation; performance assessment; sustainability; technology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070741111"

A number of approaches have been taken, including microeconomic analyses of specific technologies and macroeconomic modeling of long-term productivity gains. Most of these approaches have estimated very positive returns to investments in space. The problem is that these approaches have generally been carried out in an economic context, which no longer characterizes today's open economy, this calling for new ways to measure the tangible benefits in return for the considerable sums invested. The way to conceive technological transfer, R&D policies, collaborative modes, and evaluation procedures have changed in an open context. Such a context offers an opportunity to revisit and update the main methods and tools used to measure the economic, societal, and environmental benefits from space (in particular with regard to industry-government-university partnerships, user communities, collaboration within and between these communities, and so on). The wide variety of assumptions behind existing models often limits the range of results. Moreover, many controversies remain as to the interpretation of these results. In this article, we present the preliminary results of a three-year study, carried out on behalf of the Canadian Space Agency, on the state of the Canadian space sector. We focus on the limitations of the methodologies used to assess the indirect economic and societal impacts of public investment in space in an open innovation context. We present a new perspective on innovation in space in which innovation is not so much driven by spin-offs from the space industry, as it is by spin-ins from various terrestrial industries. This finding impacts strongly the way we measure indirect economic impacts and calls for new metrics. These new metrics should be helpful for governments and national space agencies to support long-term planification of public investments in the space sector, in order to protect and develop a national competitive advantage in niche markets with an emphasis in commercialization of space technologies on Earth and space applications. © 2015 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006809775"

Within these formal knowledge products, there are knowledge objects that synthesize the creative process performed by authors and that could take several formats such as matrices, tables, schemes, and graphics. The researchers created those knowledge objects for several purposes such as generating, managing, supporting, reporting and interpreting knowledge and information. However, this traditional way to divulge research outputs hides knowledge objects, and presents at least, three not desired consequences: (1) an interruption of the knowledge management process;(2) the dilution of the scientific and practical potential value of the knowledge objects; and (3) the use of metrics that only consider the impact of the full publication without measuring the value of embedded knowledge objects. To handle these issues, we propose a web system based on open innovation philosophy called Prometeo, for posting knowledge objects extracted from traditional publications, to enhance the dissemination of research outputs as well as upgrade scientific productivity metrics by improving knowledge and intellectual management processes within research centers and educational institutions. We propose that knowledge objects, within extensive publications, should be linked to them and in that form will potentialize the impact of the formal publication, that of the knowledge objects posted, and eventually, that of the researcher and the research center. The web system will increase science impact by observing services such as intellectual property protection and valuation. © 2019 Academic Conferences Limited.

Currently, assessing the degree of openness of a company's innovation process can be highly challenging due to many qualitative and quantitative factors with different units of measurements involved in the evaluation process. Moreover, the open innovation assessment process is affected by vagueness and uncertainty. In this paper, starting from a thorough review of the open innovation literature and following a holistic approach to open innovation assessment, a novel modular fuzzy rule based system is developed in order to help managers to evaluate the openness of their company. The proposed system allows the decision maker to assess the open innovation level of the firm by providing 19 input variables. The information is then processed by the system through 231 rules in order to compute sub-dimensions, dimensions, building blocks and finally the total degree of open innovation. Furthermore, the proposed system was tested using numerical examples and two real-world case studies of two companies. The results showed the capability of the system to assess open innovation in different scenarios, allowing the decision maker to identify the areas with strengths and weaknesses. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Fuzzy inference system; Fuzzy logic; Innovation metrics; Open innovation; Rule based system; Uncertainty","Computer circuits; Fuzzy inference; Decision makers; Fuzzy inference systems; Fuzzy logic approach; Fuzzy-Logic; Innovation assessment; Innovation metric; Innovations process; Open innovation; Rules based systems; Uncertainty; Decision making","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124603367"

Emerging from laboratory product-tests, it has evolved into a corporate testing service that measures the consumer reactions to products/concepts using a wide range of analyses/metrics. We propose that CR transform itself in light of accelerated knowledge expansion, mounting global, and local economic pressure on corporations and changing consumer needs. The transformation moves from its traditional testing into creating profoundly new knowledge of the product and understanding of the corporation's current and future customers. CR's tasks will involve: contributing/expanding science, applying open innovation principles, and driving consumer-centric innovation. We identify seven paradigm shifts that will change CR, namely: a different way of working-from testing to open sourcing; from good corporate citizen to change leader; open new product development (NPD) process; new management roles/cultures; universities and industry, new education curricula, and cooperation; from battle over control to sustainable sharing is winning model (SiW); and the central role of design. This integrative, innovative CR requires the implementation of three recommendations: start the change process now, fine-tune along the way; create a new marketing/CR department; and educate and professionalize. These recommendations provide the blueprint for jump-starting the process and call for immediate actions to deal with the severity of the crises facing the CR profession. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","consumer research; Food and beverages; new product development; open innovation; paradigm shift","Beverages; Consumer Behavior; Food; Food Industry; Humans; Marketing; Research; Beverages; Curricula; Industry; Innovation; Product development; Beverages; Curricula; Product design; Product development; Consumer research; Consumer-centric; Economic pressures; Food and beverage industry; Knowledge expansion; New product development; Open innovation; Paradigm shifts; Consumer research; Economic pressures; Food and beverage industry; Knowledge expansion; Laboratory products; New product development; Open innovation; Paradigm shifts; consumer; controlled study; human; human experiment; leadership; marketing; model; occupation; product development; university; beverage; consumer attitude; education; food; food industry; organization and management; research; trends; food industry; review; Research; Innovation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84877285812"

One of the significant problems in understanding emergence of collective creativity involves how collectives govern and coordinate the actions of individuals to maximize innovation output. Yet, relatively little is known about desirable organizing processes in open innovation communities. To this end, we examine the impact of governance mechanisms and conflict management styles on collective creativity in open source socioecologies. Systems model of creativity and proxy metrics for measuring potential for collective creativity are utilized to conduct a simulation study of Open Source Software socio-ecologies. Findings suggest that decentralized coordination schemes such as emergent selection that are observed in utility communities along with moderate degrees of assertiveness and cooperation for conflict management result in higher incidence of innovation © 2009 IEEE.","","Computer software; Management; Open systems; Simulators; Collaborative efforts; Conflict management; Decentralized coordination; Measuring potentials; Open innovation; Open Source Software; Open sources; Simulation studies; Sociotechnical; Systems models; Computer science","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-70849083206"

Researchers have proposed a variety of methods and techniques for characterising open innovation, but those metrics are overly broad because new approaches that demonstrate current practices were not included. As a result, it is critical to recognise new methods in developing countries to assist SMEs in understanding open innovation and its practices. As such, this study aims to bridge the gap in the literature pertaining to behavioural and cost factors that impact the adoption of open innovation, with an appropriability regime as a moderating factor in determining the success of adoption. This research was undertaken to study the effects of organisational citizenship behaviours, organisational culture, managerial ties, and transactional costs (the predictor variables) on the adoption of open innovation (the criterion variable) and to study the moderating role of an appropriability regime on these relationships. The research used cross-sectional data from a survey of 376 SMEs in Malaysia. This study used quantitative methodology and suitable statistical methods; 376 SME owners, managers, and high-ranking executives participated and completed the survey. A simple random sampling technique was used, and PLS–SEM regression was employed to test the related hypothesis variables. The theories adopted in this research, namely the social exchange theory and the actor–network theory, pave the way for quantitative research. The results revealed that organisational citizenship behaviours predict open innovation positively and significantly. A highly integrative culture was also found to relate positively to open innovation. In addition, managerial ties and transactional costs were found to facilitate open innovation. With respect to open innovation, appropriability regimes were found to strongly moderate the relationships between managerial ties and transactional costs. However, appropriability regimes did not strongly moderate the relationships between organisational citizenship behaviours and organisational culture. © 2022 by the authors.","actor–network theory; appropriability regimes; managerial ties; open innovation; organisational citizenship behaviours; organisational culture; social exchange theory; transactional cost","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138690902"

The authors describe an open innovation process aimed to build an information coordination system to reduce the infection diffusion within the population. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use coordination theory principles to elaborate a framework of activities, resources and dependencies among information resources and producers in the COVID-19 emergency. The framework was applied to develop a case study aimed at describing a health emergency system implemented by Dyrecta Lab (a research laboratory on computer science) and CITEL (a medical research center). Findings: The authors describe the existence of relevant “flow,” “fit” and “share” dependencies within the activities of infection containment and medical treatment. The authors identify eight key resources and a number of actors involved in those activities, and describe a platform able to gather a multitude of epidemic-related metrics with the purpose to address dependencies and support decision making. Research limitations/implications: The authors provide insights for advancing the academic discussion on process coordination principles in time-constrained, volatile and highly demanding scenarios. Practical implications: The value of the authors’ research can be identified for practitioners engaged to develop innovative development projects for public utility. The authors provide a contribution also for first responders and health operators involved in management of the current and future emergencies. Originality/value: The adoption of process coordination principles is a relatively new and powerful approach to analyze and optimize the processes that characterize the management of emergency scenarios.

We analyze the main journals and identify the most prolific authors. In addition, we observe collaborative behavior at three different levels – country, institution, and author. Second, we determine the content structure of this literature through a bibliographic coupling analysis, and characterize the resulting groups. As a result of this analysis, we describe eleven thematic groups and characterize them through different metrics. Based on these metrics and the previous analysis, we classify and explain the studies about co-creation in the technology and innovation management field.

The challenge is how to create value from open-source biopharmaceutical innovation. This value creation may occur via transparency and usage of data across the biopharmaceutical value chain as stakeholders move dynamically between open source and open innovation. Areas covered: In this article, several examples are used to trace the evolution of biopharmaceutical open-source initiatives. The article specifically discusses the technological challenges associated with the integration and standardization of big data; the human capacity development challenges associated with skill development around big data usage; and the data-material access challenge associated with data and material access and usage rights, particularly as the boundary between open source and open innovation becomes more fluid. Expert opinion: It is the author's opinion that the assessment of when and how value creation will occur, through open-source biopharmaceutical innovation, is paramount. The key is to determine the metrics of value creation and the necessary technological, educational and legal frameworks to support the downstream outcomes of now big data-based open-source initiatives. The continued focus on the early-stage value creation is not advisable. Instead, it would be more advisable to adopt an approach where stakeholders transform open-source initiatives into open-source discovery, crowdsourcing and open product development partnerships on the same platform. © 2014 Informa UK, Ltd.","Big biopharmaceutical data; Biopharmaceutical value creation; Common value of knowledge; Open-source biopharmaceutical innovation","Biopharmaceutics; Diffusion of Innovation; Drug Discovery; Drug Industry; Organizational Innovation; Program Development; Research Design; access to information; crowdsourcing; data base; integration; outcome assessment; pharmaceutical engineering; priority journal; product development; review; standardization; drug development; drug industry; mass communication; methodology; organization; pharmaceutics; procedures; program development","Review","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84899065045"

We propose an approach for adapting the expert search process (choosing the right type of trace and the right expertise hypothesis) to the given topic of expertise, by relying on Linked Data metrics. In a gold standard-based experiment, we have shown that there is a significant positive correlation between the values of our metrics and the precision and recall of expert search.

In the context of open innovation, positioning key members within these teams or groups based on their estimated abilities leads to more impactful results since mass collaboration is fundamentally a sociotechnical system. Determining how each individual influences the overall design process requires an understanding of the predicted mapping between their technical competency and performance. This work explores this relationship through the use of predictive models composed of various algorithms. With support of a dataset composed of documents related to the design performance of students working on their capstone design project in combination with textual descriptors representing individual technical aptitudes, correlations are explored as a method to predict overall project development performance. Each technical competency and project is represented as a distribution of topic knowledge to produce the performance metrics, which are referred to as topic competencies, since topic representations increase the ability to decompose and identify human-centric performance measures. Three methods of topic identification and five prediction models are compared based on their prediction accuracy. From this analysis, it is found that representing input variables as topics distributions and the resulting performance as a single indicator while using support vector regression provided the most accurate mapping between ability and performance. With these findings, complex open innovation projects will benefit from increased knowledge of individual ability and how that correlates to their predicted performances.

However, adopting such practices in a traditionally closed organization is a maturity process that we hypothesize cannot be undergone without friction. Objective: This study aims to investigate what challenges may occur for a newly-turned platform provider in the public sector, aiming to adopt open collaborative practices to create an ecosystem around the development of the underpinning platform. Method: An exploratory case-study is conducted at a Swedish public sector platform provider, which is creating an ecosystem around OSS and OD, related to the labor market. Data is collected through interviews, document studies, and prolonged engagement. Results: Findings highlight a fear among developers of being publicly questioned for their work, as they represent a government agency undergoing constant scrutiny. Issue trackers, roadmaps, and development processes are generally closed, while multiple channels are used for communication, causing internal and external confusion. Some developers are reluctant to communicate externally as they believe it interferes with their work. Lack of health metrics limits possibilities to follow ecosystem growth and for actors to make investment decisions. Further, an autonomous team structure is reported to complicate internal communication and enforcement of the common vision, as well as collaboration. A set of interventions for addressing the challenges are proposed, based on related work. Conclusions: We conclude that several cultural, organizational, and process-related challenges may reside, and by understanding these early on, platform providers can be preemptive in their work of building healthy ecosystems.  © 2020 Owner/Author.","Collaborative Development; Ecosystem; Open Government Data; Open Source Software","Ecosystems; Investments; Open source software; Open systems; Collaborative development; Collaborative practices; Development process; Exploratory case studies; Government agencies; Internal communications; Investment decisions; Multiple channels; Open Data","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094942399"

For this, first, we conducted a bibliometric analysis to evaluate the relationships between business model innovation and SBMI literature. After this, we performed a systematic literature review to create a comprehensive framework for managing SBMI. The biblio-metric analysis showed that the SBMI stream grew quickly and significantly in recent years, evolving into a separated new research stream, which does not leverage recent business model innovation advancements. Through the performed analyses, we were able to discuss critical gaps in the SBMI literature and shed light on possible pathways to solve these gaps through lessons learned from business model innovation. We depicted five critical gaps for managing SBMI; (1) the need to understand the sustainable business model as a wicked problem, in which SBMI leads to “better than before” solutions calling for systematic SBMI, (2) the poor definition of distinctive dimensions of dynamic capabilities for SBMI, (3) the lack of studies exploring the role of open innovation for improving the SBMI process, (4) the lack of tools supporting SBMI implementation and (5) the need to explore game-changing, competitive advantages of SBMI. The findings of this study contribute to guiding future research on SBMI, which can be a basis for further efforts towards sustainable development. © 2022 by the authors.

Unfortunately, most of the currently marketed connected devices feed vertically-oriented closed systems (commonly referred to as vertical silos) which prevent the development of a unified global IoT. This issue is all the more valid in complex environments, such as smart cities, in which exceedingly large amounts of heterogeneous sensor data are collected, and in which platforms and stakeholders should also be able to interact and cooperate. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to move towards the creation of open IoT ecosystems to support efficient smart city service integration, discovery and composition. This paper contributes to the specifications of such an ecosystem, which has been developed as part of the EU's H2020 bIoTope project. The novelty of this ecosystem compared with the current literature is threefold: (i) it is based on the extensive use of open communication and data standards, notably O-MI and O-DF standards, that foster technical, syntactic and semantic interoperability over domains; (ii) it proposes an innovative service marketplace for data/service publication, discovery and incentivization; (iii) it integrates security functionalities at the IoT gateway level. The practicability of our ecosystem has been validated through several smart city proofs-of-concept set up in three distinct cities: Helsinki, Lyon and Brussels. Given the five major themes defined in the CITYKeys (a smart city performance indicator framework), namely People, Planet, Prosperity, Governance and Propagation, bIoTope mainly contributes to Prosperity-related metrics, as discussed in this paper.  © 2013 IEEE.","communication standards; Internet of Things; open IoT ecosystem; service discovery; smart city","Commerce; Ecosystems; Gateways (computer networks); Interoperability; Semantics; Smart city; Complex environments; Heterogeneous sensors; Internet of thing (IOT); Open communication; Open innovation; Performance indicators; Semantic interoperability; Service integration; Internet of things","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097420356"

Surveying more than 1,000 executives on current open innovation practices and capabilities, IBM IBV was able to identify how the different operating model capabilities interact and complement each other to drive better innovation and business performance. Design/methodology/approach: To help organizations build and improve their open innovation capabilities, the IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV) partnered with APQC to develop the Ecosystem-Enabled Innovation Maturity Model (EEIMM) - an open standards model encompassing four domain competencies required for successful open innovation. To assess the maturity and benchmark the performance of organizations’ open innovation capabilities, the IBV, in collaboration with Oxford Economics, used the EEIMM to survey over 1000 leaders responsible for open innovation at their organizations. Findings: Four management capabilities for successfully operationalizing open innovation are: strategy and culture, ecosystem capability, internal capability and technology enablement. IBV analysis found that organizations that are more advanced in developing the four building blocks see significantly better performance across key financial and innovation metrics. Practical implications: For every dollar of investment, the proportion of direct revenue attributed to open innovation is four times higher than for traditional innovation.
