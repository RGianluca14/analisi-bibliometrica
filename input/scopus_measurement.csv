Generally, these services are performed by staff in line with the social division of labor as scientists and technicians in research institutes. However, services rarely lead to research collaborations because research collaborations generally do not stem from services per se and require researchers to engage more with partners in initiating collaboration. This article focuses on its boundary of services and research collaborations by conducting an ethnographic survey of four years since 2016 to analyze epistemic cultures in eight Japanese state-of-the-art RIs. It first examines what is occurring at the boundaries and offers two frameworks, i.e. the subject-driven approach and the user-driven approach, for finding potential solutions to the issues that impedes service from extending into research collaboration.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.","academic cultures; research infrastructures; services and research collaboration in academia","academic research; culture; innovation; labor division","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133510549"

Environmental concerns can evolve into environmental regulation in the legal sense, as well as environmental attention in informal rules. Although there has been a lot of research on environmental regulation and green open innovation (proportion of collaborative filings in green patents), there is still a lack of identification of the impact of the role of environmental attention, especially in heavily polluting industries that are critical to the economy. Based on this background, this paper uses the relevant data of listed companies in China's heavily polluting industries as a research sample. We use neural networks (Word2Vec) to extract indicators of environmental attention from the text of listed companies' annual reports and measure their impact on green open innovation using multidimensional fixed effects regression. Our research shows that the environmental attention of listed companies in highly polluting industries will significantly reduce their ability to engage in green open innovation. Ultimately, our study will help managers in heavily polluting industries rebalance the economic benefits and environmental transformation of their companies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental attention; Firm innovation; Green open innovation; Green patents; Neural network","Patents and inventions; Corporates; Environmental attention; Firm innovation; Global climates; Green open innovation; Green patent; Measurements of; Network-based; Neural-networks; Open innovation; Environmental regulations","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177834348"

Currently, academics are focusing on improving and homogenizing legitimacy measurement systems at the micro level. However, measuring legitimacy at the macro level has not evolved according to the needs and possibilities provided by new technologies. This research aims to develop a new methodology to measure organizational legitimacy at the macro level, capable of processing large amounts of information. To this end, an analysis of the news content of the 50 companies that make up the EuroStoxx50 has been conducted for a full year. By doing so, we make three key contributions to managing organizational legitimacy. First, we provide a more complete and reliable measurement of organizational legitimacy thanks to mass information processing techniques, providing a technology-based solution to the obsolescence problem of legitimacy evaluation models at the macro level. Second, we provide empirical evidence of the relationship between legitimacy and organizational success based on the analysis of mass information. Third, we show evidence that a bias is introduced in the measurement of legitimacy due to the use of different sources for this purpose. © 2021 by the authors.

However, single dimension measurement of open inno vation cannot effectively explain the complex relationship between a firm’s open innovation and the corresponding business performance. Therefore, to explore comprehensively the relationship between open innovation an d its corresponding performance, we mea sure open innovation by using both search breadth and search depth. Although many scholars have paid attention to the influence of environmental factors on the relationship between open innovation and business performance, very few studies consider environ mental factors as important mediating variables. According to strategy contingency theory, the effectiveness of outside search, which includes both search breadth and search width, will be significantly affected by the market environment (Lee, C., L ee, k. & Pennings, j. m., 2001). There are two important variables describing the market environment, namely competition intensity and volatility (Morgan, r. m. & Hunt, s. D., 1994). Existing research considers market volatility as an important environment variab le (Laursen, 2014), but few studies consider the intensity of competition as an important environment variable. However, studies have shown that when competition in the market is intense, the faster new pr oducts are introduced the higher the business perfo rmance is. Because of its speed and efficiency advantages of open innovation, the cost of open innovation can often be offset by benefit in the fierce competition environment. On the contrary, when the competition is not so intense, the cost of open innovation could not be offset by the corresponding benefit. Therefore, we consider the market competitive environment as an important environment variable to fill the research gap. In previous studies, when dealing with the measurement of open innovation for ou tside dimensions, partners usually include suppliers, customers, universities, research institutions and other p eer enterprises (Laursen, 2006). However, peer enterprises (rivals) are not listed separately. However, in the fierce competition environment co operat ion in depth with competitors is obviously different from cooperation in depth with non competitors because of knowledge leakage risks. Our study is an attempt to fill this gap. Our paper uses the questionnaire method to collect empirical data. D ifferent from previous studies using large enterprises, our paper uses small and medium sized enterprises as research objects. The first reason is that there are numerous small and medium sized enterprises in China, and they are an important part of nation al economy. Compared with large firms, small and medium sized ente rprises lack funds and personnel. they are much more urgent to rely on open innovation to help improve innovation performance. In the process of using questionnaire to collect data, we found that the frequency of open innovation in small and medium sized enterprises is high and increasing Empirical results show that when cooperating with non competitors, the market environment competition positively adjusts the relationship between ope n innovation and the corresponding performance significantly. In a fiercely competitive environment, two types of external sear ches (the depth and width of the cooperation with the non competitors) have significant positive correlations with enterprise per formance. In the less fiercely competitive environment, cooperation with the non competitors negatively adjusts the relationship between open innovation and the corresponding performance. However, when cooperating with competitors, the market environment competition negatively adjusts the relationship between open innovation and the corresponding business per for mance.That in a fiercely competitive environment, cooperating in depth with competitors negatively affects enterprise performance. For small a nd medium sized enterprises, our results show that in fiercely competitive environment, cooperating both in more breadth and in more de pth with non competitors can effectively and significantly improve business performance. In cooperating in dept h with competitors will reduce business performance. © 2019,Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management.

Open innovation is a system that creates and uses synergies from sharing and collaboration. The digital economy and society support the emergence and functioning of open innovation systems. In the Slovak Republic´s environment, the management of innovations through an open mechanism is a perspective for the development of knowledge intensive business services (KIBS). These services are an important link in the value chain of the Slovak economy focused primarily on the automotive industry. The article deals with the creation of a model of open innovation in the environment of KIBS production in the Slovak Republic. Its elements and their classification are based on the results of the primary survey carried out by the Delphi method. The importance of individual elements thus reflects the priorities of innovation management of KIBS companies in the Slovak Republic. In the current theory, we do not find a model with these specifications. The presented model thus represents an original result supported by the primary research in a specific environment. The construction of the model identifies three building components of the open innovation mechanism: preparation and planning, implementation, evaluation of outputs and a value creation. They are complemented by factors, risks and effects. The model provides the possibility of measurement at the level of inputs and outputs. © 2020 by author(s).","Knowledge intensive businees services; Model; Open innovation; The Slovak Republic","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097006161"

The study investigates innovation in large Swedish retail companies, focusing on monitoring and measurement of innovation performance. Through a qualitative, multiple case study, our findings reveal that retailers are aiming to become more active innovators. They are exerting a greater control over the innovation process, implementing a range of financial and non-financial indicators that encompass inputs, outputs, and the process itself. Innovation projects serve as vehicles for experimentation and learning about how to improve the structure of innovation efforts. However, challenges still arise when strategic objectives are not aligned with performance measurements across the organisation. Nonetheless, existing performance measurement practices can support innovation capability development in retail, especially in relation to culture and competence development and utilising external knowledge for open innovation. The paper advances theory by offering insights into how retailers gain more control of innovation through measurement, contributing to the growing landscape of strategic innovation management in retail. We propose a model, informed by theoretically built framework and empirical data, to guide retail organisations in defining new measurements that promote a holistic perspective to building innovation capability. © 2023 The Author(s).

This study compared the technical efficiency of four different open innovation strategies (inward, outward, both, and closed) and analysed the associated factors. To measure the technical efficiency and technology gap ratio among the different strategic groups, we introduced stochastic frontier analysis and meta-frontier analysis in terms of open innovation. The results showed that, first, companies opening both directions hardly achieve higher technical efficiency than those with unidirectional (in-or out-wards) strategy, and second, an inward direction of knowledge flow changes companies to achieve high potential, whereas an outward direction of knowledge flow helps companies achieve high efficiency. Therefore, we insist that the direction of open innovation strategy conditions firms' technical efficiency.

Increasing the social performance of Small and Medium Industry (SMI) can be done through innovation. Innovation concept that is suitable to be implemented in SMI is open innovation. Open innovation is characterized by the existence of knowledge flow among SMIs and between SMI and stakeholders. Knowledge flow in an organization is managed through knowledge management. The relationship between knowledge management and open innovation has been discussed in previous literature. However, there is no previous research that identifies the role of knowledge management and open innovation which supports the enhancement of SMI’s social performance. In this study, a conceptual model which represents the relationship between knowledge management and social performance through open innovation in SMI context is developed and tested. The knowledge management concept is represented by knowledge identification, knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention, knowledge sharing, and knowledge application. The open innovation concept consists of two dimensions which are inbound and outbound. The social performance concept is represented by the focus on community and employee. The respondents of this study are 27 small and medium industries which produce batik in Indonesia. The model is tested using the partial least square.

This research has also looked into how OI affects gaining a competitive advantage by taking into account the moderator role of environment dynamics. Design/methodology/-pproach - Possible factors influencing OI in startups, determined through research background studies and interviews with experts in the startup fields, then along with the factors of competitive advantage and environmental dynamics, were evaluated in a sample of 120 managers of Iranian start-up companies. Using structural equation modelling, we analysed data collected from startup managers pertaining to variables of OI, competitive advantage, and environmental dynamics. Structural equation modelling is a multivariate analysis method that enables the examination of relationships among multiple variables within a model. A two-stage partial least squares structural equation modelling method was employed in this study. In the first stage, the construct validity and reliability of the measurement models were evaluated, and in the second stage, the conceptual model and research hypotheses were put to the test. -indings - Results showed that organisational entrepreneurship, open business model, knowledge management capabilities, absorption capacity, organisational readiness, and participatory capability are important influences on OI in startups. Furthermore, the study found that applying OI techniques can help startups succeed more often in gaining a competitive edge. Additionally, the study found that environmental dynamics have a positive moderating effect on this relationship. Practical impl-cations - Considering the vital role of startups in economic development programs, the results of this research can lead the managers of start-up companies and growth centers to use the OI approach to overcome the limitations of being new and small. Also to survive startups and increase productivity and competitive advantage, startup managers by focusing on these factors can take steps to create the necessary internal foundations in the organisation and negotiate with large companies in line with better policies.

In terms of open innovation, innovative production scheduling can be defined as scheduling using big data, cyber-physical systems, internet of things, cloud computing, mobile network, and so on. In this environment, one of the most important things is to develop an innovative scheduling algorithm for the sustainability of manufacturing firms. In this research, a flexible flowshop scheduling problem is considered with the properties of sequence-dependent setup and different process plans for jobs. In a flexible flowshop, there are serial workstations with multiple pieces of equipment that are able to process multiple lots simultaneously. Since the scheduling in this workshop is known to be extremely difficult, it is important to devise an efficient and effective scheduling algorithm. In this research, a heuristic algorithm is proposed based on a few dispatching rules and economic lot size model with the objective of minimizing total tardiness of orders. For the purposes of performance evaluation, a simulation study is conducted on randomly generated problem instances. The results imply that our proposed method outperforms the existing ones, and greatly enhances the sustainability of manufacturing firms. © 2017 by the authors.","Due date based measure; Flexible flowshop; Fourth industrial revolution; Heuristics; Industry 4.0; Scheduling; Sustainability of operation system","algorithm; heuristics; industrial development; industrial production; innovation; manufacturing; sustainability; technological change","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85037168483"

Based on Item Response Theory, a family of latent trait models rooted in psychology, and using data from the German section of the Community Innovation Survey, we advance a nuanced measure of openness capturing the firm-level attitudes toward external knowledge reception, going beyond current measures focusing on its attributed effects. This approach, based on an implicit attitude measure, allows us to assess the types of OI practices characterizing firms with different value structures (i.e., higher/lower attitudes toward external knowledge), thus offering a more reliable comparison of firms along the openness continuum. A systematic comparison with the widely used measures of external search breadth and depth shows that higher openness is not merely reflected by a higher number (or a more intensive use) of external knowledge sources but by a higher attitude toward complex search patterns, typically implying more challenging OI activities. The proposed construct has strong external validity, as it reflects the key theoretical features of openness and its paradoxes - an inverted U-shaped relationship with innovation performance. The results of this study provide both theoretical and practical implications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","innovative performance; open innovation attitudes; open innovation measures; openness","Community innovation surveys; External knowledge; External validities; Implicit attitudes; Innovation performance; Item response theory; Latent trait model; Theoretical foundations; Engineering","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111499478"

Recently, its intensifying role has also been noticed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, technology adoption to pursue an e-commerce model for agribusinessmen is not easy, while the COVID-19 has made them lose customers and led them to crises. In that context, the role of social capital (SC) has increasingly been paid significant attention, especially for micro and family businesses. Agribusinessmen can use SC to adopt technology, renew and reinforce their businesses in the global agricultural supply chain disruption context. However, there seems to be a dearth of an integral measurement of social capital (IMSC) to apply to the practice effectively. Recognizing this need, the current study aims to develop an integral scale for SC. Design/methodology/approach: This research adopts a widely accepted and rigorous scale development process, a mixed-methods research design and essential statistical techniques to develop an IMSC. Findings: The result develops an IMSC consisting of nine facets: linking-corporate, bonding-bridging, trust in political institutions, trust in public services, generalized social trust, norms and social sanctions, subjective safety, civicness and community cohesiveness. The scales of these facets are found to be unidimensional, reliable and valid. Originality/value: This is the first study developing an IMSC to contribute to the extant literature. The study also provides managerial implications for practitioners to strengthen SC and adopt technology to improve their businesses. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Agribusiness; E-commerce; Open innovation; Scale development; Social capital; Technology adoption","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119495741"

As prescribed by the confirmation phase of theory building model, the approach has been successfully applied to a real innovation project. The paper contributes to clarifying the concept of innovation openness and attempts to improve its measurement by adopting a micro-level unit of analysis (i.e., single KS within an innovation project) as well as dimensions that extant literature considers relevant to managing external collaborations. The proposed approach can also support firms involved in an innovation project to (i) identify and measure the criticality of knowledge supplies, (ii) assess the openness of the adopted innovation practices, and (iii) support ex-post learning on the way the project was managed. © 2021 by the authors.

Since it is worth noticing how one’s EI is formed; therefore, the prime purpose of this paper is to estimate the underlying concepts of proactive personality (PP) in establishing potential entrepreneurs’ EI through the mediating role of both specific self-efficacy and broader self-efficacy. This research investigates the parallel mediation and the role of mediators in the form of a series between PP and EI via broader self-efficacy and specific self-efficacy. The extant research employed a quantitative methodology by using a self-administered questionnaire technique. Data were collected using the cluster sampling technique from a sample size of 700 respondents in the higher education sector. To test the measurement and structural modeling, the PLS-SEM technique was deployed using Smart PLS 2.0 M3 software. Regarding the direct relationships, findings infer that PP is positively associated with three broader forms of self-efficacy, which determine specific self-efficacy. Findings indicated that broader forms of self-efficacy and specific self-efficacy play the role of the serial mediators in the relationship between proactive personality and entrepreneurial intentions. The research carries important implications for the university policymakers in Pakistan to develop their self-reliant “business incubation centers”, initiate experiential learning-based projects, improvise competency-based curriculum, design innovative projection techniques, and follow open innovation dynamics to establish an entrepreneurial culture. © 2020 by the authors.

Nevertheless, the water sector has been claimed to be less innovative than other sectors. This Special Volume on the dynamics of water innovation is based on the realization that, in general, there is a striking absence of academic studies on the dynamics of water innovation. This SV is therefore designed to lay the foundations for the field of water innovation studies, in an effort to integrate the emerging insights. Together, the contributions in this SV capture the current understanding of the dynamics of water innovation and provide insights into how the water innovation process can be fostered. The purpose of this introductory article is threefold, namely to frame the discussion on water innovation dynamics in order to contextualise the contributions of this SV, to provide systematic guidance for studying water innovation dynamics and to suggest the way forward for water innovation studies. It captures the extent of the field of water innovation studies with a review of the literature of the last three decades and frames water innovations. Based on five decades of innovation research and drawing on three areas (management, strategy and policy), we provide an innovation studies taxonomy that consists of four organising dimensions: type of innovation, stage of innovation, level of analysis and measurement. This taxonomy enables researchers to study the dynamics of water innovation from different combinations of conceptual and thematic angles, drawing on the field of innovation studies in a systematic fashion. Finally, we reflect on the way forward for water innovation studies with suggestions for future research. © 2017 The Authors","Business model innovation; Financing innovation; Frugal innovation; Innovation measurement; Innovation systems; Mission oriented policy; Open innovation; Organisational innovation; Product innovation; Service innovation; Social innovation; Technological innovation; Water; Water innovation","Innovation; Taxonomies; Water; Business model innovation; Financing innovation; Frugal innovations; Innovation measurements; Innovation system; Mission-oriented; Open innovation; Organisational innovations; Product innovation; Service innovation; Social innovations; Technological innovation; Dynamics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85033363732"

Based on the structural contingency theory, structural adaptation theory, and the investigation of 426 enterprises, this study tries to discuss the moderating effect of open culture (OC) and open organization (OO) in the process of inbound open innovation (IOI) and outbound open innovation (OOI) affecting enterprise growth (EG). The results show that both IOI and OOI are positively related to the EG, and their interaction item is also positively related to EG. Besides, OC and OO are positively associated with EG. What is more, both OC and OO can enhance the positive correlation between OOI and EG. However, the moderating effect of OC and OO between IOI and EG is not significant. Furthermore, compared with the IOI, the OOI may need the fitness of OC and OO, so that enterprises can benefit from the open innovation better and sustainably. This article develops the measurement scale of OC and OO in combination with the OI context, expands the research results of organizational culture and organizational structure in the OI context, enriches the research results in the fields of OI, OC, OO, and EG, and provides practical enlightenment on organizational construction for enterprises to benefit from open innovation.

Innovation is a complex process, which is difficult to measure in an objective manner. In this work and for the first time, a quantitative measure for open innovation has been developed and validated to determine the performance of a firm within the marine biotechnology sector in Oman. This breakthrough was achieved in four steps. First, the characteristics of the two dimensions of open innovation (‘breadth’ and ‘depth’) were identified using a critical review of the literature and a series of pre-tests of a survey design with industrial experts. Second, a quantitative index for open innovation by measuring these two dimensions at firm level was developed. Third, validation of this five-item scale was conducted using the UK Community Innovation Survey (CIS) data set. Fourth, the five-item scale was applied to 22 firms in the marine bio-industry sector in Oman using a case study approach, and was used to rank the firms according to their open innovation index. This analysis shows how Omani marine bio-industry firms could strengthen their open innovation efforts, for example by collaborating more effectively with government organizations and research institutes to thereby boost the quality of their open innovation activities in a measurable way. © 2018 The Authors","Innovation management; Innovation policy; Marine biotechnology; Networks; Oman; Open innovation index","Oman; United Kingdom; biotechnology; high technology industry; index method; industrial performance; innovation; marine technology; technology policy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050354907"

The authors propose that an organization’s attitude toward interactive OI activities among OI stakeholders can reveal its degree of capability. This paper aims to focus on an organization’s OI attitude measurement scales and develop a framework linked to the role perspectives and loci of OI activities occurring at the organizational level. This research will intro-duce a practical, theory‐based indication of OI assessment by combining a deductive process that identifies organizational OI attitude constructs with an inductive framework development process. First, the authors conducted an extensive literature review of attitude measurement on the execution of OI. Then, they performed empirical data analysis using a large‐scale structured attitude assessment survey from individuals in domestic and multi‐national corporations (n = 134), which led to the development of questionnaire sets on attitude evaluation. This study contributes to developing an organizational OI attitude assessment scale. Furthermore, based on empirical data analysis, the research framework demonstrated the reliability and validity of the organizational OI attitude measurement scale. Specifically, the scale contains proven questionnaires assessing OI attitudes by interrogating individual actors’ impact, behavior, and cognition regarding their organization’s OI activities. The organization’s three role perspectives (transfer, absorption, and brokerage) and two loci of activities in the OI ecosystem provide six distinct dimensions, suggesting areas of focus for a firm’s strategic OI direction. © 2022 by the authors.

Findings: Most detailed analysis of the time-course revealed that the innovation efficiency of P&G improved rapidly and substantially after its embracing of OI, an effect we term the “open rise”. However, there is also a transient decline in R&D efficiency at the beginning of OI adoption (“open dip”) and an unexpected and marked decline (“open drop”) after the peak positive effect.

Successful supplier involvement largely depends on an effective performance measurement process, but both supply chain management and innovation management literature have paid limited attention to this aspect. This paper aims to fill this gap by illustrating how companies measure the performance of the suppliers involved in their innovation projects and what role is played by the purchasing department. Design/methodology/approach: This study interviews project stakeholders from nine different organizations acting as focal companies in the supply chains of various industries. This paper complements this on-field information with a vast amount of data collected from secondary project documents. Structured data coding and analysis allow us to discuss how companies redesign their performance measurement systems to ease the collaboration with suppliers in innovation and what factors underly these decisions. Findings: The findings show that, in many cases, supplier performance measurement systems deviate from their typical characteristics to support collaboration in innovation projects. They integrate quantitative and qualitative measures, include contributions from different project stakeholders and are oriented toward high visibility and transparency with suppliers. A more substantial redesign of these systems is favored when purchasing is assigned to strategic project responsibilities and possesses higher absorptive capacity. Originality/value: The results complement the knowledge for the supply chain management field, where supplier performance measurement systems have been discussed in the context of traditional buyer-supplier relationships, but not comprehensively in innovation projects and not considering the role of purchasing. Findings also contribute to the innovation management literature, which has mostly focused on what aspects need to be measured for innovation partners, rather than how to manage the performance measurement process in practice. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Absorptive capacity; Buyer-supplier relationships; Open innovation; Performance measurement; Purchasing; Supplier involvement; Supplier-manufacturer relationships","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107831112"

OI is relevant for small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) because it allows them to adapt and thrive in increasingly turbulent and dynamic competitive environments, generate competitive advantages, and increase their performances. The method adopted for measuring OI is heterogeneous because of the breadth of the concept and application of various OI metrics and practices. This study analyzes the various methods used for measuring OI in the SME context through a systematic review of the empirical literature. To meet this objective, a two-step methodological approach was implemented: first, a systematic literature review, and second, a bibliometric analysis. Finally, 125 empirical articles from 2009 to 2020 were selected from the Web of Science and Scopus databases. The results show that the empirical literature uses a wide variety of methods to measure OI activities. While this adds to the richness of the concept, it makes theory development difficult. Based on the systematic literature review conducted, it is clear that there are different perspectives pertaining to the measurement of OI: (1) external knowledge sources, internal knowledge, and collaboration; (2) technology exploitation and technology exploration; (3) inbound, outbound, and couple; and (4) openness. This study has important implications to researchers and SME managers, will help them develop a better understanding of how OI activities can be measured. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bibliometrics; Empirical studies; Measures; Open innovation; SME","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125936880"

UIC have different dynamics from intra-firm collaborations, thus the need to focus specifically on this niche topic. The discussion and measurement of the determinants of collaboration have been appraised from different perspectives, in an effort to attain the somewhat 'strategically overloading' and 'utopic' idea of a perfect balance between the university's three missions: Teaching, research, and entrepreneurship. This equilibrium has proven possible in regions with high absorptive capacity, feeding the European Commission's conviction that such a framework could be attained in European regions with Higher Education Institutions (HEI). The article aims to explore further the role of geographical proximity in UIC and the complementarity between 'soft' and 'hard' collaborations with academia. This is the first survey to comprehensively address the topic of Open Innovation in Portugal encompassing a sectoral and regional analysis on both the firm and the university level. A dataset was built combining: A) firm data from SABI; b) a questionnaire with 908 valid responses; c) distance matrices based on python programming to evaluate different proxies for geography. Three alternative measures for geography were produced: Linear distance, road distance and travel time. Econometric estimations were run to achieve a twofold target: To obtain a general overview of the role of proximity in UIC and to draw an individual university collaboration profile. The empirical results provide evidence about the different impact of geography according to the proxy in use, reinforcing the role of methodological choices in the achievement of reliable results. When moving from simple to multinomial models, adjustments can be observed in terms of the determinants of UIC. Entrepreneurial ecosystems depend on the establishment of strong ties between universities and firms, normally enhanced by public policy. Incorrect appraisals of contact enhancers and the lack of a full understanding of proximity and its dimensions will undermine the success of policy actions and, consequently, condemn to failure the cohesive and sustainable growth of regions. © 2020 Academic Conferences Limited.

The AMI allows the automatic and remote measurement and monitoring of energy consumption. It also provides important information for the management of peak demand and energy consumption and costs. Pohang University of Science Technology (POSTECH) has developed its own AMI and an IT platform called Open Innovation Big Data Center (OIBC) to store and share various data collected in the campus. In this work, we describe the AMI and the OIBC platform equipped with various sensors and systems for measuring, storing, calling, and monitoring data. Data are collected from seven buildings with different characteristics. We installed 266 sensors at the buildings, including 188 EnerTalk and Biz, 18 plugin, and 60 high-sampling sensors. The sensors collect electricity consumption data in real time, and users can visualize and download the data through the OIBC platform. In this work, we present analysis results of the collected data. The results show that the amounts of electricity consumed by campus buildings are different depending on various factors, including building size, occupant type and their behaviors, and building use. We also compare the amounts of electricity consumed before and after the COVID-19 outbreak.

This usually implies the integration of knowledge in technology transfer which can be accrued via the knowledge sharing between parties. However, by looking into the technological and social change literature, previous studies were mainly focused on macro-foundation of technology transfer and organizational innovative capabilities with less consideration to the role of psychological precursors of collaborations. Due to this gap, we intended to build a consistent conceptual basis for collaborations and technology transfer practices at the micro level.

Performance of know-how transfer is affected by accuracy of the stated aim (learning outcomes), applied teaching, learning and assessment methods and both internal and external environment characteristics of the stakeholders involved in the process. Both the know-how transfer performance measurements and the developed six step process model are presented in the paper. Implications and recommendations for future research are given. © The Author(s). 2017.","Action research; Constructive alignment; Know-how transfer; Knowledge; Learning outcomes; Open innovation; Performance; Technology","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098731163"

In particular, a compilation of drivers and barriers for OI implementation is absent from the literature. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to identify critical success factors (CSFs) for OI implementation at the firm level. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review was conducted in order to identify CSFs for OI implementation in previously published literature. A total of 2,894 papers were identified, 156 of which were subjected to full independent analysis by the three authors. The following aspects were considered: research strategy, approach (empirical or theoretical) and objectives; theoretical background; methodological procedures; main results; and contributions to the literature. If the paper reported empirical research that included a description of actual OI implementation, additional aspects were analyzed: industry or sector of application; firm characteristics; success of OI implementation and OI tools and techniques reported. Findings: A synthetizing framework with six thematic categories of CSFs was proposed: leadership, internal innovation capability, network and relationships, strategy, technology management, and culture. A total of 22 CSFs for OI implementation were identified within these categories. Originality/value: The proposed framework is an attempt to systematically generate a comprehensive list of factors that impact OI implementation. As such, it can support the theoretical development of OI-related capabilities, and serve as basis for future research that investigates operationalization and measurement of such capabilities. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Critical success factors; Implementation practices; Open innovation; Systematic literature review","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049646334"

Excesses of time and cost are common and are even more accentuated for building renovation. Recently, the building information modeling (BIM) methodology has strongly entered in the construction sector and appears to be an effective paradigm shift. Considering all of the previously mentioned aspects, this article addresses the identification and analysis of the critical barriers of renovation and the potential for digitalisation to overcome them using BIM. The methodology that was used is based on an open innovation approach called Living Labs, where consultations with the key stakeholders of the construction process aims for a higher digitalisation to focus on real needs and fitted to the user’s requirements. Starting from a worldwide survey, the analysis of the Spanish casuistry is deepened. From the analysis of barriers and opportunities, the necessary requirements for an optimal BIM application in renovation are highlighted. After identifying the key aspects that each stakeholder’ typology has considered as relevant, a set of key performance indicators have been selected, to monitor the improvements in the renovation process when BIM is adopted. © 2021 by the authors.

A new model combining principal component analysis (PCA) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) is applied in or-der to obtain an efficiency score. To achieve a more comprehensive evaluation, a large dataset is included, but a large number of variables compared with the number of decision-making units (DMUs) may diminish the discriminatory power of DEA. To avoid this effect, we first apply PCA to separately obtain the input and output main factors. We then apply DEA to the new variables. The PCA–DEA model allows us to identify 5 efficient sectors out of 42. If only DEA were applied, 16 sectors would turn out to be efficient. This shows that the model improves the discriminatory capability of DEA. Methodologically, this work contributes to the literature by proposing an efficiency measurement using a large number of inputs and outputs that could be applied in different fields. Likewise, this analysis allows for the evaluation and interpretation of innovation activity in the different sectors, which can be taken into account in the management and allocation of resources by institutions. © 2021 by the authors.

By comparing patent citations with primary data reported by the inventors, we uncover systematic measurement errors in patent citations and show that they depend on the firms' patent strategies (e.g., to reduce the risk of imitation or litigation), the source of knowledge employed (e.g., competitors, users), the technology of the underlying invention, and the institutional characteristics of the patent system. Our findings about the role of these factors in external knowledge sourcing and citing propensity highlight the importance of firms' strategic behavior and offer novel insights for the use of patent citations as an indicator of knowledge flows. Managerial Summary: Firms' open innovation strategies rely on the sourcing of knowledge from other organizations. Tracing these knowledge flows is difficult, such that the empirical research on this matter typically uses citations that patents make to prior art in order to track them. However, patent citations might be added also for reasons other than the actual transfer of knowledge. We use primary information from a large survey of inventors to assess the accuracy of patent citations to measure knowledge flows, and we find evidence of measurement errors that depend on the applicants' patent strategies, the type of knowledge sources used, the filing jurisdiction, and the technology of the underlying invention. We offer insights to evaluate the settings in which patent citations are a reliable measure of knowledge flows. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","external search strategy; knowledge flows; measurement error; patent citations; patent strategy","Knowledge management; Laws and legislation; Measurement errors; Risk assessment; Systematic errors; Empirical research; Knowledge flow; Patent citation; Patent strategy; Patented invention; Search strategies; Strategic Behavior; Transfer of knowledge; Patents and inventions","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063637394"

The competitive advantage of the firms depends highly on successful knowledge management. According to earlier studies on growth seeking innovative firms, company performance and measurement should be connected to the management of intellectual capital. However, the open innovation paradigm, lack of resources and rapidly evolving technologies are challenging to both managerial decision making and the conventional protection of intellectual property rights (IPRs). Hence, good management of IPRs, knowledge sharing and future technology anticipation are the decisive driving factors for the international growth and wealth of the firms. In addition, a better integration of innovation processes to business models is required. Previous academic research indicates that this could be achieved by connecting those processes to the performance and measures of the firm by other management functions, such as human resource management. The aim of this paper was to explore the current trends of human resource management (HRM) in identifying and managing the increasingly complex issue of IPRs. This research attempted to find answers to the question of what perceptions the managers of SMEs have of IPRs and, furthermore, of how they recognise those individuals, teams, projects or processes that they need to engage in order to implement and communicate the pursued strategies. Six representative executives or HRM managers from technology driven SMEs in Finland were interviewed by using semi-structured interviews. The primary data was analysed by using content analysis. The findings indicate that the IPR knowledge base in firms is often key person centric and that the recognition of IPR is not made explicit in the company. The management of IPR is not aligned with the business practises, and the shortage of resources can lead to the outsourcing of strategically important activities, such as IPR processes or sales. It can be claimed that IPR management should be seen as a core and mission-critical process for growth aspiring SMEs, and well planned human resource processes would be here the natural contributors. © Copyright The Authors, 2018.

The inadequacy of this preparation and the chaotic nature of inter-agency and inter-governmental communication has been well noted in several official reports on the disaster. In response, Safecast, an international, volunteer-based organization devoted to monitoring and openly sharing information on environmental radiation and other pollutants, was initiated on 12 March 2011, one day following the start of the accident. Since then the group has implemented participatory, open-source, citizen-science-centered radiation mapping solutions developed through a process of collaborative open innovation. The information Safecast provided has proven useful to experts, to policy makers, and to the public. This paper briefly describes the methodology and toolsets Safecast has developed and deployed, as well as organizational and social aspects, and summarizes key results obtained to date. In addition, it discusses appropriate criteria for evaluating the success of citizen-science efforts like Safecast, and places it in context with other non-governmental radiation monitoring efforts. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Citizen science; Crowdsourcing; Fukushima; Ionizing radiation; Media; Public information; Safecast","Crowdsourcing; Disasters; Ionizing radiation; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactors; Public risks; Radiation; Social aspects; Citizen science; Fukushima; Media; Public information; Safecast; Emergency services","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84974627778"

Currently, assessing the degree of openness of a company's innovation process can be highly challenging due to many qualitative and quantitative factors with different units of measurements involved in the evaluation process. Moreover, the open innovation assessment process is affected by vagueness and uncertainty. In this paper, starting from a thorough review of the open innovation literature and following a holistic approach to open innovation assessment, a novel modular fuzzy rule based system is developed in order to help managers to evaluate the openness of their company. The proposed system allows the decision maker to assess the open innovation level of the firm by providing 19 input variables. The information is then processed by the system through 231 rules in order to compute sub-dimensions, dimensions, building blocks and finally the total degree of open innovation. Furthermore, the proposed system was tested using numerical examples and two real-world case studies of two companies. The results showed the capability of the system to assess open innovation in different scenarios, allowing the decision maker to identify the areas with strengths and weaknesses. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Fuzzy inference system; Fuzzy logic; Innovation metrics; Open innovation; Rule based system; Uncertainty","Computer circuits; Fuzzy inference; Decision makers; Fuzzy inference systems; Fuzzy logic approach; Fuzzy-Logic; Innovation assessment; Innovation metric; Innovations process; Open innovation; Rules based systems; Uncertainty; Decision making","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124603367"

However, there are few researches on the measurement of knowledge transfer efficiency in the context of OI networks. To make up this gap, this study explores the measurement of knowledge transfer efficiency based on the weighted OI network. Firstly, this paper builds the weighted OI network model with node and edge weights. On the basis of the weighted OI network model, the weighted path length and clustering coefficient are introduced and analysed. Moreover, the efficiency of knowledge transfer is further proposed as the main measure of knowledge transfer efficiency by comprehensively embodying the above factors, and then an extended application of the proposed main measure is developed to identify and locate the important members with great impact on knowledge transfer. Finally, a real case of several OI networks is provided to illustrate the applicability of the weighted OI network model and the knowledge transfer efficiency measurement method. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Efficiency of knowledge transfer; Knowledge transfer; Member importance; Open innovation network; Weighted complex network","Complex networks; Efficiency; Open Data; Clustering coefficient; Edge weights; Knowledge transfer; Member importance; Network modeling; Open innovation; Path length; Weighted complex networks; Knowledge management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073905935"

Referring to the COVID-19 pandemic as a sustainability crisis that has sensitized consumers and other stakeholders to corporate responsibility for social and sustainability issues, a conceptual framework for stakeholder integration is developed from which implications for designing the potential, process and result quality are derived. Design/methodology/approach: In this conceptual paper, design options for stakeholder integration are derived from open innovation and service management research. Specific crisis-related determinants of stakeholder integration are derived from current corporate social responsibility (CSR) and crisis research taking into account the opportunities and challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design options and crisis-related determinants are then combined to a conceptual framework for stakeholder integration in sustainability project partnerships in times of crisis. Based on this framework, research propositions are derived that provide insights into the design of the potential, process and result quality of stakeholder integration. Findings: This paper shows that the COVID-19 pandemic can be viewed as a sustainability crisis, which places special entrepreneurial demands on stakeholder integration in sustainability project partnerships. The pandemic offers potential for integrating a large number of stakeholders and has emphasized the need for integrating a broad range of stakeholders. Higher skepticism of stakeholders toward companies' CSR engagement in the pandemic has raised stakeholder demands for early integration. Higher skepticism and CSR involvement have rendered active forms of integration even more relevant, which, however, should still be adapted to the respective stakeholder prerequisites. The pandemic has increased the need for constant and comprehensive exchange of data on project results between stakeholders and the project leading organization. Measurement of target achievement can be promoted by establishing stakeholder commitment with regard to the target measures on the collective and relationship levels of the partnership. Finally, the pandemic has reinforced the need for more dialogical forms of communicating sustainability project results. Originality/value: Solving problems and exploiting opportunities in times of crisis require a high degree of entrepreneurship and creative leadership in order to gain new ideas and overcome resource deficits. Sustainability project partnerships in which various stakeholders contribute resources and knowledge to collaborate on idea development and finding solutions to sustainability issues are suitable for this. However, previous approaches to stakeholder integration in open innovation and service management research largely neglect the crisis context and only a few are related to sustainability. In CSR and crisis research, stakeholder-related approaches to coping with crises tend to be underrepresented, and the comprehensive concept of stakeholder integration has so far hardly been considered as an approach to crisis management. By taking into account the COVID-19 pandemic as a sustainability crisis, this paper provides new impulses for the integration of stakeholders in sustainability project partnerships in times of crisis. Recommendations for the design of the potential, process and result quality are derived, which provide insights for project leaders and stakeholders alike. In addition, implications for public policymakers are derived, who are assigned an increasingly active role in the pandemic and who can contribute to the success of sustainability project partnerships by setting suitable framework conditions. The developed concept can be expanded to include further company-related determinants and offers a starting point for empirical analysis in the still underexplored research fields of sustainability-oriented relationship marketing and sustainability crises. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Relationship management; Stakeholder integration; Stakeholder management; Sustainability crisis; Sustainability marketing; Sustainability project partnership","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107829019"

Results showed a positive, significant relationship between OI and overall firm performance (r= 0.20) while revealing numerous contingencies. Particularly, we found that the effect of OI on non-financial performance (r= 0.20) is larger than that on financial performance (r= 0.19), while the disaggregate results revealed that inbound OI has the strongest effect on firm performance (r= 0.23), followed by outbound OI (r= 0.19) and coupled OI (r= 0.14). Furthermore, it was found that the mixed results are driven by both contextual factors (i.e., firm size, culture, study region, sector, and industry intensity) and measurement moderators (i.e., study measure and data type).

Despite the popularity and success of these applications, current research has yet to fully explore the potential of ESM applications as a driver of employee-driven innovation, specifically through advancements in innovation culture. To fill this gap, this study proposes a theoretical framework that explains the role of ESM applications in facilitating employee innovation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors administered a cross-sectional survey to collect data from professionals who use ESM applications regularly at work.

Next, the results confirmed the importance of ESM use in encouraging individual innovation productivity in terms of product/service innovation, process innovation and social innovation. Finally, the results corroborated the mediating role of risk-taking and knowledge-sharing culture in the use of ESM to increase innovation productivity.

Given that one cannot manage a business without measuring these assets, researchers and practitioners deem that the lack of a practical measuring tool for design is the cause of this unfavorable situation. Hence, establishing relevant criteria for measuring design effectiveness is essential for developing the tools. However, criteria must anticipate key business outcomes in order to demonstrate effectiveness, and to propose actionable items. Whether the outcome is sales figures or customer satisfaction survey results, the criteria should clearly link with business goals. Also, the technologies in the Fourth Industrial Revolution facilitate the quantification of customer behaviour related to business performance, such as lingering time on the website for shopping. In this context, statistical understanding of design elements is critical for determining appropriate strategies in the era of digitalised data. By utilising a Service Blueprint, this study also proposes a novel approach to tackle current challenges regarding the open innovation process. Since appropriately-developed design elements are the prerequisite of successful measurement, this study extracts the elements through in-depth interviews, and examines them quantitatively with existing business theory.

This article uses a unique new dataset combined with an open innovation competition to evaluate a wide range of approaches developed by 294 competitors from 20 countries. The competition's objective was to address a deconvolution problem critical to analyzing genetic perturbations from the Connectivity Map. The issue consists of separating gene expression of individual genes from raw measurements obtained from gene pairs. We evaluated the outcomes using ground-truth data (direct measurements for single genes) obtained from the same samples. Results: We find that the top-ranked algorithm, based on random forest regression, beat the other methods in accuracy and reproducibility; more traditional gaussian-mixture methods performed well and tended to be faster, and the best deep learning approach yielded outcomes slightly inferior to the above methods.

As the executors of strategic decisions, the attitude and capabilities of senior managers determine the effectiveness of implementing green innovation. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the relationship between executive compensation incentives and green innovation. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the data of heavily polluting enterprises listed in China's A-share market from 2015 to 2020, this study constructs an OLS model with fixed effects of time and industry, and uses the mediation three-step method to verify the correlation between executive compensation incentives, innovation openness and green innovation. Meanwhile, the grouping regression was used to test the moderating effect of environmental regulation on executive compensation incentives. Findings: The empirical results show that executive salary incentives promote green innovation and equity incentives inhibit green innovation; the openness breadth partially mediates the relationship between salary incentives, equity incentives and green innovation, while the openness depth only partially mediates the relationship between equity incentives and green innovation; and environmental regulation positively moderates executive incentives. Research limitations/implications: Due to sample selection and variable measurement, the study lacks certain generality. Therefore, future research needs to further analyze the internal factors affecting green innovation from multiple dimensions. Practical implications: This study provides a new evidence for analyzing how executive compensation measures affect green innovation, and further enhances the mediating mechanism of open innovation.

Attention has also been paid to examine the moderating effect of team diversity and the extent of virtuality on GVT performance. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected using structured questionnaire and tested using partial least square – structural equation modelling. The authors collected 263 sample and the assessment of reflective measurement models, structural model, reliability and validity were conducted subsequently. Findings: This paper found that team climates like team cohesion, team confidence, and team knowledge, skills, and abilities demonstrated different impact on the human dimensions which include trust and creativity. It will then subsequently affect GVTs’ performance. Besides, team diversity which comprised of three major components that include age diversity, functional diversity, and attitudes/values diversity was found to moderate the relationships between the antecedents and consequent. In spite of that, the extent of virtuality was found to have no moderating effects on the relationships between the team creativity and trust and perceived team performance. Originality/value: As nowadays an increasing number of firms are becoming global, inquiring into GVTs efficient management is of crucial importance for successful implementation of open innovation practices, while GBS companies could represent the most suitable setting to examine the GVT’s underlying principles. This paper integrates adaptive structuration theory with input-mediator-output-input model to provide a holistic study on GVTs’ performance. In addition, this study also illustrated how the extent of virtually can be measured quantitatively. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adaptive structuration theory; Global virtual team; Mediator-output-input model; PLS; Team performance","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85043452634"

Aim: This article seeks to identify the factors of inbound open innovation and whether these factors influence the financial performance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Nigerian oil and gas industry. Setting: This article examines 150 indigenous oil and gas SMEs in the upstream subsector of the Nigerian petroleum sector through a survey, using a questionnaire, conducted in 2015. Methods: The study applied the structural equation modelling (SEM) method. This method is used to test the relationships between the factors and to calculate the measurement errors in the hypotheses formulated. Results: The results show that technology scouting, vertical technology collaboration (VTC) and horizontal technology collaboration (HTC) positively and significantly contribute to inbound open innovation, which are thus significant in influencing the financial performance of SMEs. The size of technical staff and research and development (R&D) fund allocations also have a positive and significant correlation with the SMEs’ financial performance. Meanwhile, the age of SMEs is negative and not significant in influencing financial performance. Conclusion: The results suggest that inbound open innovation through scouting, HTC and VTC should therefore be encouraged among SMEs to boost their internal capabilities, which have hitherto enhanced their financial performance. The management members of each SME should continually consider collaboration with the external actors because they cannot singularly possess all the innovative skills required in the industry. Also, each firm should commit itself to allocate more funds to R&D and at the same time should hire those who have relevant production skills and train the existing ones in their firms. © 2018.

Understanding the process of establishing trust between people and groups implies understanding the various sociological, psychological, cultural and economic relations that determine the structure of trust. Most often in the literature trust is defined through dimensions that are not always clearly identified and that often aggravate the trust measurement problems. This paper analyzes the dimensions of trust, perceived through different theoretical approaches and concepts, but also through the results of a case study research in Serbia. According to conducted research one of the bases for the development of trust is the assessment of the competence of the other party in communication and interaction process. The aim of this paper is to point out the possible benefits obtained by researching the role of trust among employees. The obtained results open numerous questions related to subjective assessments in business communications, the possibilities of their objectification, but also the potential for creating open innovations in organizations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Business communication; Open innovation; Organizations; Trust","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161440884"

To further improve the efficiency of crowdsourcing contests, two-stage elimination contests are often used as a selection mechanism by firms. This paper explores two forms of elimination mechanisms: sub-elimination and sequential-elimination. Using game theory and auction theory approaches, we model the game between a contest seeker and participants and derive the equilibrium results under these two forms, including the equilibrium decisions and corresponding expected payoff for the contest seeker and the effort strategy at each stage and total expected surplus for all participants. Our results show that: (i) Under both forms, it is optimal to have exactly two participants competing with each other in the final stage; (ii) In equilibrium in the sub-elimination contest, all participants exert more effort in each stage when the number of participants remaining is smaller. The equilibrium effort strategy of high-ability participants has the same trend in a sequential-elimination contest, but the low-ability participant's equilibrium effort level in the final contest is first decreasing and then increasing in the number of remaining participants; (iii) The optimal two-stage elimination form is sequential-elimination for the contest seeker when compared with no-elimination and sub-elimination because under sequential-elimination, all participants in the second stage will exert more effort, leading to higher-quality solutions. Additionally, we find that this form is also preferred by high-ability participants. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","All-pay auction; Incentives; Innovation crowdsourcing; Two-stage elimination","auction; comparative study; crowdsourcing; efficiency measurement; game theory; incentive; innovation; numerical model","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097384143"

Measurement strategy requires feasible variables that make up those goals. This strategy also ensures that all variables that are important in measuring contribute to the larger goals. A useful way to assess and explain the effectiveness of the technology transfer office (TTO) of universities is to model this within a production function/frontier framework. Such a production function is typically estimated econometrically. This study presents evidence on the relative efficiency of research commercialization in the university through the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model. The implication of the DEA efficiency result is to derive the efficiency level of the TTO's strategy from the observed performance. It also helps in identifying the benchmarking of other TTOs, which would be valuable information for improving their new technology commercialization strategy. In detail, a benchmark is provided to improve the weakness of strategy and resource allocation of a poorly performing TTO. The proposed matrix of indicators is an exploit of how performance could be measured within the decision-making units that have been chosen.

Through an abductive study, we compare how these middle managers reason about their work with performance indicators to mobilise top managers towards an OI strategy. Findings show that the situational nuances middle managers find themselves in, such as the extent of strategic support for an OI strategy by top managers and the degree to which OI practices are adopted, plays a critical role in influencing how they work with performance indicators. According to these situational nuances, we distinguish different OI contexts which affect how middle managers reason about their work with performance indicators.

The paper maps and characterizes the conditions of open innovation against cleaner production in Indonesian batik small and medium enterprise (SME), particularly in Java and Madura. The mapping process is executed by classifying the batik SME into four quadrants. The diagram is a quadrant in which there are four parts to distinguish each of the ability of batik SMEs in understanding and achieving cleaner production through open innovation. This research will obtain a new method or model that can be applied by organizations to achieve cleaner production through an open innovation. The data is obtained from 182 batik SMEs located in Laweyan, Madura and Lasem (in Java Island, Indonesia). Design/methodology/approach: One of the problems in batik SME is the waste management from the dyeing and wax removal process. In the first stages of this research, a number of initial models were elaborated as a reference, then the results of the elaboration became a new research model. The research model that has been produced is then tested using data from respondents. Based on the test results, the model can be stated valid or not. In this study, the model is valid after testing data from 182 respondents, because all outer loading for all indicators is above 0.7. The composite reliability and AVE values of all constructs were above 0.7 and 0.5. Based on the validated research model, the data is statistically processed by using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). By using the SEM method and statistical software SMART PLS 3.0this research can be supported to achieve the research objectives. Findings: Based on data testing and processing, open innovation climate could predict a sustained relationship to open innovation with an accuracy rate of 0.466 and influence rate of 0.427, whereas open innovation could predict a sustained relationship to cleaner production with an accuracy rate of 0.183 and influence rate of 0.324. The relationships between open innovation climate and open innovation; including open innovation toward cleaner production, are statistically significant because all prediction values and accuracy in the model have met the criteria for measurement parameters based on the value of R2, p value and T-statistics to be stated as a significant relationship. Research limitations/implications: This research provides an overview of the influence and importance of open innovation in creating an environmentally friendly production process in the context of cleaner production. Cleaner production on batik SMEs can be achieved through open innovation, both for inbound open innovation and outbound open innovation. Open innovation comprehensively provides support for batik SMEs in achieving cleaner production. Open innovation can be run well and optimally if it gets support from a conducive climate open innovation. Furthermore, the implementation of cleaner production could be a guideline for the owner to minimize the waste from batik SME production, both for natural and synthetic dyes. Some limitations in these study include the absence of influence from the existing stakeholders on batik SMEs on the implementation process of open innovation; the use of the cross-sectional approach that results in the unavailability of further analysis regarding the dynamics or improvements that occur in attaining cleaner production through open innovation; and finally providing no analysis of the differences in characteristics at each location of batik SMEs. Originality/value: The implementation of cleaner production model is considered as one of the new methods and references in conjunction with reducing the negative impact of waste toward the environment, particularly in the traditional textile industry which is limited in waste management capability. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Batik SMEs; Cleaner production; Open innovation","Data handling; Forecasting; Pollution control; Scanning electron microscopy; Textile industry; Waste management; Composite Reliability; Design/methodology/approach; Implementation process; Management capabilities; Measurement parameters; Small and medium enterprise; Statistical software; Structural equation modeling; Climate models","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097226923"

The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of breadth, depth and partner newness on product innovativeness and product competitive advantage. The authors also seek to examine the contingent effects of the appropriability regime. The authors make suggestions to academics and practitioners based on the findings. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a structured survey instrument producing an empirical analysis of 205 NPD projects in the manufacturing sector in the UK. The authors use an ordinary least squares regression model to test hypothesised relationships between openness (breadth, depth and partner newness), product innovativeness, product competitive advantage and the appropriability regime. Findings: The authors find that each of the three dimensions of openness, depth, breadth and partner newness, have a significant but differing impact on product innovativeness. Specifically, the study indicates that breadth has a positive effect but only in the presence of a strong appropriability regime, partner newness has a direct positive effect, and depth a direct negative effect. The authors also find that product innovativeness has a positive impact on product competitive advantage. Research limitations/implications: Further research should focus on replicating the findings in other countries, search for further moderating factors, such as the stage of the NPD process, and analyse the longitudinal impact of openness within NPD projects. Practical implications: Organisations are encouraging managers to be more open in their approach to NPD. The authors’ findings suggest that managers need to think about the three dimensions of openness, breadth, depth and partner newness. Their engagement with each of these dimensions depends on the desired outcomes of the innovation project and the strength of patents. Originality/value: The research extends the extant supplier involvement in new product development literature to examine the effect of up to 11 types of external actor in NPD projects. The authors test a new multi-dimensional measurement scale for the openness construct. The authors show that each dimension has a different relationship with product innovativeness. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Empirical; Innovation; Integration; New product development","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85031802019"

The programs are components of a broader agency leadership initiative focused on policies that promote a culture of open innovation and entrepreneurship aimed at improving workforce problem-solving capabilities and mission results. Data were collected and analyzed over a five-year period of employee experience in the two programs. The evaluations included surveys and structured interviews conducted among the participants of both programs. Longitudinally, the curation of data about the value of these programs to employees in their self-assessed ability to pursue and achieve institutional objectives supported iterative adjustments in program operations. Results were also benchmarked against data from the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, an annual organizational survey designed to elucidate attitudes among federal employees across a variety of topics, including innovation and empowerment. This report provides insights into the qualitative and quantitative parameters capable of being leveraged to maximize the design, measurement, and impact of innovationrelated programs and activities. The methods and data described herein represent a medium through which employee-based organizational perceptions about culture can be interrogated and examined.

To assess the DIC of NISs, a composite weighting method was used to obtain the score of our selection of 65 countries. The results show the spatio-temporal evolution of DIC from 2010 to 2018 and explore the interactions among sub-elements within the framework.

This was followed by correlational analysis with the innovation practices by these groups. Qualitative survey data was also collected and used to interpret the results. Findings: Overall innovation scores have improved over the decade. Organizations are still struggling with process drivers such as idea management and innovation measures. High innovators are pervasively using innovative methods to advance innovation execution much more than low innovators.

The innovations need to be tested in licensed laboratories in order to create certified products if they are to be commercialized to the market. Many universities have established laboratories that provide testing services to society and act as a revenue-generating source. Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS) owns an accredited center laboratory that provides testing services to external parties. In addition, the university owns other laboratories in several faculties to conduct academic activities and research and yet provide testing services, but have not been accredited. Therefore, the laboratories have the potential to be developed as part of the testing service business to support the incubation process of new technology and provide testing services. In this article, we chose UNS, one of the universities in Indonesia, to develop a framework of readiness level measurement instrument, to evaluate the readiness and to suggest improvements for laboratories to achieve accreditation. A framework of laboratory readiness measurement was developed using integration of management approach and laboratory approach.

Three metrics are introduced to evaluate the weight of collaborations on both the total business of companies and their patent portfolio: collaboration costs share, collaboration revenues share and joint patents share. A sample of 114 worldwide top R&D spending bio-pharmaceutical firms is analysed and eight clusters are defined, from closed sole-patenting to coupled joint-patenting. The work proposes a novel way to assess collaboration processes, identifying their impact on the business model of companies. Furthermore, it integrates metrics for collaboration process and outputs within a comprehensive measurement system. Drawing on objective and available data from both consolidated annual reports and PATSTAT, the framework allows managers to evaluate the collaborative position of their firms, monitoring its evolution and benchmarking with competitors.

Research has ranged from case study representations to large-scale quantitative studies using the Community Innovation Survey data or developing novel approaches to measuring open innovation. In this study, we conceptualise and validate a firm-level measure of proclivity for open innovation, which relates to the firm’s predisposition to perform inbound and outbound open innovation activities. To do so, we focus on smaller firms, assessing their organisational and behavioural perspectives related to open innovation. Building on existing scholarly research and a field study, we begin by conceptualising the theoretical framework of the multidimensional construct. We then develop and validate its measurement scale on two cross-cultural samples. The measure contains the following dimensions: inward IP licensing and external participation, outsourcing R&D and external networking, customer involvement, employee involvement, venturing, and outward IP licensing. Our results indicate that the measure has good reliability and validity.

We exploit container-based NFs to achieve low performance overhead, fast deployment and high reusability missing from today's NFV deployments. Through an SDN northbound API, NFs can be instantiated, traffic can be steered through the desired policy chain and applications can raise notifications. We demonstrate the systems operation through the development of exemplar NFs from common Operating System utility binaries, and we show that container-based NFV improves function instantiation time by up to 68% over existing hypervisor-based alternatives, and scales to one hundred co-located NFs while incurring sub-millisecond latency. © 2015 IEEE.","Containers; Middleboxes; Noise measurement; Ports (Computers); Routing; Servers; Virtualization","Containers; Network security; Reusability; Servers; Software defined networking; Transfer functions; Virtual reality; Virtualization; Enterprise networks; Fast deployments; Middleboxes; Noise measurements; Operating system utilities; Ports (Computers); Routing; Systems operation; Network function virtualization","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961928044"

Reviewing previous research reveals a gap in the application of a project’s detailed features and historical data to support the bid/no-bid decision and to determine the cost and time contract mark-ups. In this study, a prescriptive project complexity-based model is proposed to support the bid decision in the tender strategy development phase of a contractor for the downstream sector of the petroleum industry in Iran. For this purpose, regression analysis of historical data is adopted to configure the model and to infer from previous actual trends by exploring relationships between the contractor’s bid decision and proposed mark-ups with the project’s inherent and surrounding complexity factors. Hence, using experts’ opinions and historical data from 139 previous contracts as training and test data, a model was developed to make a decision on a bid and mark-up problem. The results of the model validation show that the credibility of the model is 74.67% and 75.36% for time and cost, respectively, and the reliability of model outputs is approximately 90% overall in predicting the bid mark-ups in accordance with the project complexity index (PCI). The main contribution of this research to current knowledge has two aspects: utilizing the complexity concept for the tender problem in the form of a project complexity index (PCI) and considering both time and cost mark-ups (TMU–CMU) in the contractor’s bid simultaneously. In addition, the results show that the more complex the project is, the higher the bid rate is. © 2022 by the authors.

Design/methodology/approach: Accordingly, transaction cost economics was used to relate the choice and implementation of open innovation using a sample of 250 electronics and information start-ups in China. Structural equation modeling was used to conduct confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate measurement model, while logistic regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses. Findings: As expected, the dedicated asset specificity, human asset specificity, behavioral uncertainty, transaction frequency, and small number exchange were positively associated with outbound open innovation.

In the meantime, quadruple and quintuple helices have been adopted by the European Committee for the Regions and the European Commission as metaphors for further strategy development such as in EU-programs in Smart Specialization, Plan S, Open Innovation 2.0, etc. Here we argue that the transition from a double helix to a triple helix can change the dynamic from a trajectory to a regime. However, next-order transitions (e.g., to quadruple, quintuple, or n-tuple helices) can be decomposed and recombined into interacting Triple Helices. For example, in the case of four helices A, B, C, and D, one can distinguish ABC, ABD, ACD, and BCD; each triplet can generate synergy. The triple-helix synergy indicator can thus be elaborated for more than three dimensions. However, whether innovation systems are national, regional, sectorial, triple-helix, quadruple-helix, etc., can inform policies with evidence if one proceeds to measurement. A variety of perspectives can be used to interpret the data.

Addressing this challenge requires first understanding and then managing individuals’ perception of co-innovation risks. The purpose of this paper is to provide a meaningful approach to addressing co-innovation risks using a valid and reliable model to assess actors’ perception of risk and examine its effect on actor co-innovation behavior. Design/methodology/approach: The construct of co-innovation risk from the actor’s perspective was conceptualized based on a case study of a co-innovation network. The measurement items underwent a pilot study and a field study to establish the necessary reliability and validity. This paper also empirically assesses a nomological network that illustrates the effect of risk on co-innovation behavior with a moderating effect of prior experience. Findings: Co-innovation actors perceived four different individual risks: time, social, intellectual property right, and financial. The empirical results from the field study demonstrate a high degree of confidence in both translation validity and criterion-related validity. Negative effects of perceived co-innovation risk on actors’ continuous intention to ideate, collaborate, and communicate in co-innovation were evident, but prior experience moderated these relationships. Originality/value: Drawing from co-innovation and individual risk literature, this study develops and validates a general instrument to measure co-innovation risk from the actors’ perspective. The result is a reliable and parsimonious instrument with 15 items, which contributes significantly to future empirical investigations of co-innovation behavior on virtual platforms. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Collaborative innovation network; Experience; Instrument; Open innovation; Risk; Social product development","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047967931"

Addressing a social network analysis (SNA) perspective, this paper proposes that an organization's technological capacity is highly related to its network position. The data analyzed in this paper includes 963 collaborative research plans from a telecommunication project sponsored by National Science Councils in Taiwan from 1998 to 2007. There are 88 nationwide educational departments participating in this project. Their publications and patents are accumulated as performance indicators. The measurement from SNA, degree centrality and betweenness, are taken as variables. Four of the findings are: first, the geographic effect on network formation is less. Next, an organization plays an intermediate in research collaboration would be likely to gain more funding. Then, an organization performs better while it takes active approach to collaboration. Last, the collaborative researches in universities are academic oriented. The gap of transformation publications into patents needs more attention to make up. © 2009 PICMET.","","Behavioral research; Benchmarking; Electric network analysis; Patents and inventions; Technological forecasting; Betweenness; Collaborative research; Degree centrality; Educational departments; National Science Council; Network formation; Open innovation; Performance indicators; Research collaborations; Science and technology programs; Social network analysis; Technological collaboration; Technological development; Technological networks; Technology network; Technology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-70450190065"

These advantages have increasingly drawn researchers' attentions to the ways that technology solutions could be retrieved to address firms' technology needs. However, prior studies were either (i) manual and effort-intensive or (ii) focused on data analytics instead of providing a technology solution for a technology need. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-layered semantic search to tackle the above problems. First, we propose a multi-layered search approach in which each layer encompasses a semantic capability for ac-quiring relevant technology solutions. Second, we propose a novel multi-layered similarity-measurement strategy, called NSk, to estimate the relatedness between a technology need and a technology solution, with respect to the layer k. Our prototype OIG (short for Open Innovation Gate) is evaluated through a case study of finding technology solutions for a real-world technology need requiring ""facial recognition"".

This paper describes a set of network visualizations and animations that were developed in co-creation with the Demola operators to make visible the activity that Demola has initiated. Moreover, the development process used to design the visualizations and the technical process that was applied are described and discussed. We claim that static network visualizations and animations of an open innovation platform development are useful in presenting, describing, marketing and selling the platform for existing and new stakeholders. Our experience shows that in order to develop visualizations and animations that meet the requirements set by the different stakeholders, an iterative and incremental development process is needed.

Results show a negative correlation of openness with firm age, dimension and efficiency and a positive correlation with R&D intensity, with biotech companies being more open than pharmaceutical ones. Further, the most relevant component of openness is represented by the revenues deriving from joint development projects, out-licensing and R&D outsourcing.

However, different from most innovation surveys which mainly try to gather the whole innovation picture in some industry or country, we outline the specific innovation profiles of outstanding companies to offer benchmark effect in this study. Based on the most updated CIS4 questionnaire, this study chose the nominated companies of Taiwan Industrial Technology Advancement Awards as samples and total 61 responses were collected. The results show that these outstanding companies pursue an obviously higher frequency in adopting multiple innovations. Organizational, marketing and strategic innovations also bring significant benefits on performance. On the other side, when these outstanding companies urge to enhance their innovation capability, they choose to invest R&D by themselves and centralize in Taiwan instead of cooperating with outside resources.

The chapter attempts to provide a relevant picture of the research-related linkages of Hungarian universities and foreign companies by employing secondary data processed from various data-banks. The analysis suggests that foreign direct investment and foreign companies play major roles in the internationalisation of research during this second decade of the transition process. Assessing the research and technology products which have originated in university-industry collaboration is no easy task. According to experimental measurements and pilot data-bank, there were more joint publications involving foreign than domestic companies, and the citation value per publication was significantly higher with the former. Data-bank also show that developments in new technology in terms of patent figures rarely involved university-owned or co-owned inventions, although there is some evidence there are more patents which are university-related than owned. Domestic invention and the foreign ownership of patents represent one more sign of Hungarian involvement in global innovation in the development of new technologies. © 2010, IGI Global.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84898275747"

Case studies have detailed its performance effects, while other studies showed the effectiveness of an aspect of open innovation, such as collaboration with third parties, external technology commercialization, and cocreation. Though most studies report a positive relation between open innovation and innovation performance, some studies indicate possible negative effects. This has resulted in a call for research on what kind of organizational context suits open innovation best. This study therefore addresses two questions: (1) does performing open innovation activities lead to increased innovation performance, and to which aspects of innovation performance is open innovation most strongly related? (2) what is the moderating impact of various kinds of strategic orientation on the relation between open innovation and innovation performance? In this study, we investigate three types of strategic orientations: entrepreneurial orientation, market orientation, and resource orientation. In a survey among 223 Asian service firms, we first develop and test a comprehensive measurement scale for open innovation that captures the entire range of open innovation activities, including outside-in activities, inside-out activities, and coupled activities. The final scale comprises of 10 items and indicates to what extent a firm has implemented open innovation activities. Next, we study the relation between open innovation and innovation performance. The results indicate that performing open innovation activities is significantly and positively related to all four dimensions of innovation performance: new product/service innovativeness, new product/service success, customer performance, and financial performance. The impact of open innovation is not limited to a particular aspect of innovation performance; it positively affects a broad range of innovation performance indicators. Though open innovation is positively related to all four dimensions of innovation performance, the effect sizes are not equal. The impact on new service innovativeness and financial performance is relatively stronger. Regarding the influence of a firm's strategic orientation, we find that all significant moderation effects are positive. This suggests that, in general, having a more explicit strategic orientation enhances the effectiveness of open innovation. When comparing the three strategic orientations, entrepreneurial orientation strengthens the positive performance effects of open innovation significantly more than market orientation and resource orientation do. In turn, market orientation has a significantly stronger moderation effect than resource orientation. These findings provide empirical evidence of the context dependency of open innovation. Especially an entrepreneurial orientation, which is associated with proactive and entrepreneurial processes, seems to create a fertile setting for open innovation. © 2014 Product Development & Management Association.","","Commerce; Comprehensive measurement; Entrepreneurial orientation; Entrepreneurial process; Financial performance; Innovation performance; Organizational context; Strategic orientation; Technology commercializations; Service industry","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84908077655"

Therefore, it is important to consider the peculiarities of R&D projects when evaluating the performance of open innovation strategies, as well as to explore how the benefits and costs of open innovation are shaped by cross-level interactions. This study identifies the differences between successful and unsuccessful open innovation projects, in both firm-level and project-level terms. We focus on small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which usually lack the full set of internal resources and competences required to effectively develop, produce, and commercialize their innovations, and thus must adopt open innovation approaches more actively for sustainability. Adopting an empirical approach, we conducted a survey of 517 Korean SMEs and analyzed 241 successful and unsuccessful open innovation projects in depth. By combining measurements at the firm and project levels, this study provides new insight into the intra-organizational challenges of implementing open innovation projects, which are not only helpful to strategic decision-makers in SMEs, but also to those who make policies for them. © 2016 by the authors.","Comparative analysis; Multi-level analysis; Open innovation; Project; SME; Sustainable growth","Korea; comparative study; growth modeling; innovation; planning method; project assessment; research and development; statistical analysis; survey method; sustainable development","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960373905"

In order to empower the role of citizen in this context, we propose an approach that relies on the establishment of a physical and intellectual space for shared understanding and collaboration between all stakeholders impacted by an environmental problem (in our case odour emission). Based on the development of an Information Technology (IT) system allowing odour emission measurement as well as the collection of citizen feedback, a Living Lab (LL) approach is being implemented that involves citizens, public authorities, industry and environmental non-governmental organisations (NGOs). According to the definition of the European commission, Living Labs are ""open innovation environments in real-life settings, in which userdriven innovation is fully integrated within the co-creation process of new services, products and societal infrastructures"". Based on this definition and considering, in our case, citizens as one of the end-users of the IT system, we argue that such an approach will empower their role in local environmental governance. This article presents the method and techniques that will be used in order to set up such a Living Lab. More precisely, we focus here on the first step of this method: defining the components that will support the management of a Living Lab relying on an IT system. This step consists in the identification of the Living Lab stakeholders (citizen, industry, public authorities, NGOs, etc.), including their characteristics, fears, expectations, involvement and engagement regarding the Living Lab. To do this, 2 main approaches are being combined: A Living Lab approach that aims to involve citizens in local Environmental Governance (LEG) design. Use of Human-Centred Design (HCD), to combine IT developments and LL needs, for example Personas methodology and usability test. A Living Lab relies mainly on stakeholders' involvement in order to build trust and establish a common goal. In this sense, sociologists' approaches ((Akrich et al. 2006);) bring valuable information on how to mobilise different actors in order to innovate (Actor Network Theory). However, in the innovation process, these approaches are only considering human actors and do not take into account any technological aspects. However, if Living Labs are relying on human actors' interactions it should also take into account their interactions with the IT system it is based on. In this case, Human- Centred Design (HCD) being an approach that aims to make IT systems usable and useful by focusing on the users, their needs and requirements, is to be considered as complementary to the sociologists approaches. This article, based on the work performed in the FP7 European project OMNISCIENTIS, presents the theoretical context in which this study takes place as well as the overall methodology. © 2014 The Authors.","Citizens' involvement; Environmental governance; Human-centred design; Living lab","Design; Environmental technology; Government data processing; Information theory; Social sciences computing; Societies and institutions; Citizens' involvement; Environmental governances; Environmental problems; Human centred design; Living lab; Non-governmental organisations; Technological aspects; User-driven innovation; Laboratories","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006401144"

Therefore a three-stage approach is applied to estimate net innovation efficiency that excludes advantage or disadvantage from environmental factors. This study estimates net innovation efficiency that terminates effects of external factors placed in out of operational control of firm using the three-stage approach.

There is a constant need for identification of newer business models, blockbuster products and excellent talent in breaking the linearity paradigm. The latter half of the 20th century has seen some of the major breakthroughs resulting into a significant surge in productivity. Some of these were technology, quality, adoption of management disciplines, inorganic moves and information technology, among others. As these were good practices, and were easy to ape, many of these got duplicated far and wide. Firms got hit with the wall of marginal utility. Innovations emerged increasingly important for firms to gear up to the opportunity and break the linearity paradigm. It helped firms introduce disruptions, giving them a huge advantage which was difficult to copy. Courtesy, proliferation and globalization, closed paradigm of Innovation got severely challenged, causing a need to look beyond firm's own innovation value chain. This open paradigm of innovation required newer technologies and catalysts to create a crucible to ideas, talent and capital, coming from various sources. The paper discusses various models successfully practiced by leading organizations in achieving a non-liner business growth through open innovation. Also are discussed enabler of open innovation, catalysts, measurement parameters and other practices.

However, this closed innovation strategy has, in recent years, been superseded by an open innovation strategy. The existing measurement model of intellectual capital, which is concerned mainly with an internal dimension, is no longer appropriate for open innovation practice. To address this challenge, this paper reconstructs the measurement model of intellectual capital, expanding the concept to include both internal and external dimensions, both of which have the same three elements: human, structural, and relationship capital. To test the reliability and validity of this new model, we explore the impact of each element on innovation performance through an empirical study of 149 companies in China, and we find that all elements of internal and external intellectual capital have a significantly positive impact on innovation performance. This implies that our new measurement is appropriate for firms with an increasing degree of openness for innovation.

Based on existing innovation and virtual community management approaches, an open-innovation community scorecard is developed that consists of an innovation process, a community member, an organizational learning and a financial perspective. The scorecard helps operators of OIC to systematically manage their OIC in order to harness the full potential of this mode of customer integration. An innovation performance measurement perspective is used and the most important goals of such OICs are transformed into operations that can be measured and managed. Based on its implementation at the software producer SAP, suggestions for its implementation are offered. © 2013 Woodhead Publishing Limited All rights reserved.","Balanced scorecard; Innovation community; Management; Open innovation; Performance measurement; Virtual community","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84902565583"

The aim of this model is to determine the scientific, technological and innovatory capacity of the region, reinforce the regional capacity for the generation, management and use of knowledge, consolidate the institutional nature of the Regional System of Science, Technology and Innovation, and encourage innovation in production sectors. This research uses the empirical-analytical method to respond to the question, 'How to use knowledge management as a driving force for innovation and the production transformation of a region in a developing country?' The model is based mainly on the theoretical bases of triple helix innovation which brings together institutional players of the university, industry and State, as well as the knowledge activities identified by Holsapple y Joshi in the Intellectus model of the measurement and management of intangibles. The results show that the production transformation of the region based on knowledge management and innovation is not a spontaneous process, it requires effort on the part of the players within a regulatory framework which generates mechanisms which will enable the production sector to add greater value to their processes, products and services as a result of interaction with the research networks, centers and groups and their networks for transferring the results of their research. This model is organized around the dynamics of the Regional System of Science, Technology and Innovation, to be put to use by those institutions which play a decisive role in the region such as Departmental Council for Science, Technology, and Innovation (CODECTI), the University-Firm-State Committee of Valle del Cauca (CUEEV), the Network of Universities for Innovation in Valle del Cauca (RUPIV) and the Regional Commission for Competitiveness of Valle del Cauca (CRCV).","Competitiveness; Innovation; Knowledge management; Open innovation; Production transformation; Regional innovation system; Relationship university-firmstate","Competition; Developing countries; Industry; Knowledge management; Regional planning; Research; Societies and institutions; Competitiveness; Driving forces; Knowledge management model; Open innovation; Production sector; Products and services; Region-based; Regional innovation systems; Regulatory frameworks; Relationship university-firmstate; Research networks; Spontaneous process; Theoretical basis; Triple helixes; Innovation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84872658955"

External sources of knowledge become more prominent, while external channels to market also offer greater promise. This complicates the evaluation of early-stage technology projects, which often involve significant technical and market uncertainty. In such circumstances, companies need to ""play poker"" as well as chess. Measurement errors (false positives, false negatives) are likely to arise from judgments about the commercial potential of early-stage projects. Most companies' policies consciously limit ""false positives"" in assessing a project's commercial potential, but few companies take steps to manage the risk of ""false negatives."" New metrics may help a firm focus more upon external sources of innovation to enhance its business model, and enable the firm to salvage value from false negatives that otherwise would be lost.","","Industrial research; Investments; Project management; Research and development management; Closed innovation; Industrial innovation; Market uncertainty; Open innovation; Industrial management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0346503010"

Therefore, this paper presents and discusses the framework of a new formal platform for assessing the quality of heterogeneous software requirements, which are obtain from open innovations.

This article considers the challenges in each of these areas with reference to current industry practices for developing inhaled products, and suggests collaborative scientific approaches to address these challenges. The portfolio of molecules requiring delivery by inhalation has expanded rapidly to include novel drugs for lung disease, combination therapies, biopharmaceuticals and candidates for systemic delivery via the lung. For these drugs to be developed as inhaled medicines, a better understanding of their fate in the lungs and how this might be modified is required. Harmonised approaches based on 'best practice' are advocated for dosimetry and safety studies; this would provide coherent data to help product developers and regulatory agencies differentiate new inhaled drug products. To date, there are limited reports describing full temporal relationships between pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) measurements. A better understanding of pulmonary PK and PK/PD relationships would help mitigate the risk of not engaging successfully or persistently with the drug target as well as identifying the potential for drug accumulation in the lung or excessive systemic exposure. Recommendations are made for (i) better industry-academia-regulatory co-operation, (ii) sharing of pre-competitive data, and (iii) open innovation through collaborative research in key topics such as lung deposition, drug solubility and dissolution in lung fluid, adaptive responses in safety studies, biomarker development and validation, the role of transporters in pulmonary drug disposition, target localisation within the lung and the determinants of local efficacy following inhaled drug administration. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","ADME; Aerosol dosimetry; Deposition; Inhalation toxicology; Isolated perfused lung; Pharmacodynamics; Pharmacokinetics; Transporter","Administration, Inhalation; Animals; Drug Delivery Systems; Drug Design; Humans; Lung; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Accident prevention; Atmospheric aerosols; Biological organs; Disease control; Dissolution; Dosimetry; Drug therapy; Enzyme inhibition; Innovation; Medicine; Pharmacokinetics; Product development; antibiotic agent; beta 2 adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; ciprofloxacin; ipratropium bromide; liposome; long acting drug; respiratory tract agent; rifampicin; Adaptive response; ADME; Best-practices; Biopharmaceuticals; Coherent data; Collaborative research; Combination therapy; Critical factors; Drug administration; Drug solubility; Drug targets; Industry practices; Inhalation toxicology; Isolated perfused lung; Key topics; Localisation; Lung disease; Open innovation; Product developers; Pulmonary drug; Regulatory agencies; Safety studies; Temporal relationships; Transporter; aerosol; area under the curve; asthma; bioequivalence; bronchoscopy; bronchus mucosa; chronic obstructive lung disease; computational fluid dynamics; cystic fibrosis; dose calculation; dosimetry; drug absorption; drug blood level; drug delivery system; drug disposition; drug elimination; drug formulation; drug industry; drug metabolism; drug response; drug safety; drug solubility; human; image analysis; lung disease; lung lavage; lung parenchyma; lung tuberculosis; maximum plasma concentration; microdialysis; nonhuman; pneumonia; priority journal; product development; review; risk factor; sputum analysis; time to maximum plasma concentration; toxicity testing; toxicokinetics; Drug products","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79953027576"

The instrument is designed to examine the willingness of those involved in supply chains (SCs) to apply open innovation. It may also be used to observe the potential role of customers, competitors and suppliers in improving the performance of SCs. Design/methodology/approach – This survey of the extant studies of Multinational Automobiles Assembly lines in Egypt involved a questionnaire, which was provided across all grades at the middle managerial level. This questionnaire was divided into two main sections. The first section was concerned with elements of open innovation such as innovation, shared values and shared knowledge. The second section was focused on interrelated types of organizational and extra-organizational trust. Findings – The developed instrument was designed to access and analyze the different types of trust required for the optimal application of open innovation. Its purpose was to enhance customer satisfaction, and to help to create better internal-customer performance and the provision of innovative products. This explorative study indicated that Multinational Automobile Assembly lines in Egypt are willing to apply open innovation methods to improve their performance. Research limitations/implications – The study had a number of limitations. As the survey was conducted entirely on Multinational Automobile Assembly lines in Egypt, the applicability of the proposed scale will need to be tested further on different countries and types of industry. Originality/value – There is little empirical research about implementation of open innovation.

When selecting ideas, coalitions form and their composition may influence the resulting set of accepted ideas. We expect that computing coalitional strength during idea selection will help in forming the right teams to have a grand coalition, or having a better allocation of accepted ideas, or neutralising factors that adversely influence the decision making process.

Specifically, it focuses on the adoption of the open innovation paradigm in practice and the extent of collaboration with different stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed hypotheses are tested empirically using survey data collected from stock-listed companies in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. The data include the complete responses from 141 R&D managers for the period from 2004 to 2008. Findings: The openness of the outside-in process in R&D management is of crucial importance for achieving high direct and indirect innovation output effects. In particular, openness towards customers, suppliers and universities has a significant positive impact on the different innovation performance measures. Regarding openness towards cross-sector companies, the analysis reveals a significant negative effect on innovation performance. Research limitations/implications: The utilization of cross-sectional data and its dependency on the perceptions and experiences of the respondents has its limitations. Thus, future research should be based on a more longitudinal design that emphasizes quantitative measurement techniques. Originality/value: To date, the adoption of open innovation in practice has not been examined in depth. This study provides empirical insights into the open innovation approaches in German-speaking countries and, by drawing important conclusions for managers involved in the R&D processes, fills a gap in the innovation management literature. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Innovation; Innovation performance; Open innovation; Openness; Outside-in process; Stakeholders","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80053640465"

The period of 2008-2012 was analyzed for a total of 340 statistical units. Our results suggest that open innovation is a very pervasive behavior among smaller and younger companies, for which internal R&D is complementary to openness; still being in the development phase, they derive most of their revenues from open innovation itself and show negative financial performances. Yet, a wider range of open transactions are performed by larger and longer established firms, exhibiting good financial performances and adopting open innovation as a substitution to internal R&D efforts. Through an in-depth review of the literature, this paper contributes to the research on open innovation by providing an accounting measurement system, testing six hypotheses among open innovation and some firm-level variables, and positioning the obtained results within the current debate. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Financial performances; inbound; innovation metrics; open innovation (OI); outbound; pharmaceutical industry","Economics; Finance; Financial performance; inbound; Open innovation; outbound; Pharmaceutical industry; Innovation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027943025"

Specifically, it focuses on the roles played by trust and knowledge diversity in leveraging indirect social capital for OI returns through a trusted bridging chainmade up of individuals referred to the chain through trust relations. Essentially, indirect social capital can be seen as the returns derived specifically from indirect relationships, either through a chain of referred relationships or through by-chance relationships. Indirect social capital may therefore be defined as 'information or knowledge (new or improved resources) made available to individuals or collectivities through a trusted bridging chain or through (by-chance) indirect relationships'. Studies on innovation networks show the importance of both supporting relations (depicting trust) and bridging relations (representing access to diverse information) for innovation returns. In essence, it is argued that individual A will ask individual B to help solve an innovation problem or to find another person (C) who can solve it, if A thinks B has benevolence-based trust in A, and A has competence-based trust in B. Hence, competence-based trust would drive the quality of the chain and thus the innovation solutions submitted. Typically, the search horizon for external innovations is at a single (direct) level, representing mostly direct relationships between the focal organisation (or intermediary) and the innovators. Studies on OI suggest that organisations can over-search, as too many diverse relationships can become less effective and more expensive. So there is an opportunity to develop an OI search ""filter"" to facilitate external search. Studies on OI have not openly covered either the role of ordinary individuals' indirect relationships in innovation searches, or the context and nature of dyadic external relations per se. Studies on social networking, such as small-world studies, demonstrate how new or enhanced resources can be obtained using an instrumental search through supporting relations, alongside ""short paths"" formed through bridging relations, in effect resulting in a chain. The context and nature of a search chain have not featured much in such studies, though. Furthermore, in most social networking studies diversity is identified by measuring structural holes (the disconnects between direct relations to an ego) or the strength of ties (particularly weak ties). Yet, the latter measurement has not always proven to be a proxy for diversity, and analysing structural holes requires access to network ties around the ego and not merely a dyadic relation. This study suggests an improved measurement of dyadic tie diversity that encompasses knowledge and geographic distance between individuals in a dyadic relationship. Considering the importance of diversity for innovation per se, it is argued that a chain that bridges knowledge and geographic boundaries may better deliver innovative solutions. A trusted bridging chain could reach across the world to solve a developing-world problem in the developed world, for example. Finally, the proposed study puts forward levels of social capital - direct and indirect - to help define social capital better. The research problem requires an outcome-driven analysis based on variance logic, and a quasi-experiment to set up the necessary treatment to examine the proposed relationship between indirect social capital and OI with hypothesised relationships.

Analyzing each and every possibility in detail is out of the question as resources are limited and module details are often proprietary information. To meet this challenge the thermal engineer needs a feeling about what will and what will not work out, without getting bogged down in too much detail. This paper presents the concepts of characteristic length and cooling circle as an approximate measure for the extent of heat spreading in beam and in flat thin plate geometries. Beam and flat thin plate geometries are widely used by mechanical designers, and being able to assess how much of the geometry is actually thermally affected by a heat source is of great value in thermal decision making and communication. For both geometries an application is discussed and compared to CFD simulations to assess the validity of the approach. ©2010 IEEE.","","Product design; Thermal variables measurement; CFD simulations; Characteristic length; Complex networks; Consumer market; End-products; Heat sources; Heat spreading; Modular designs; Open innovation; Proprietary information; Thermal engineers; Thin plate; Geometry","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77952647975"

One promising way to open up the innovation process is to interact with innovation intermediaries either to find new co-development partners or to promote new technologies. However, the extensive literature dealing with open innovation needs to be enriched by studies highlighting the role of new innovation intermediaries at the new product development (NPD) level. To do so, this paper presents a concrete technological case study to illustrate the mechanism of innovation intermediaries in promoting under-development technologies. A qualitative research approach was used to analyse the performance of classical innovation consulting approaches when compared with web-based intermediaries also known as 'markets for technology' or 'open innovation accelerators'. The findings give a better understanding of the intrinsic performance and the added value of new intermediaries in order to open up the innovation process in the bio-industrial sectors.
